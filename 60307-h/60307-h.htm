  <h2 class='c005'>SCENE I<br /> <span class='large'>GLASS WITH CARE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>A limitless expanse of opal sea,
calm and unruffled, reflecting the
crimson and gold of the sky, as the
sun went down behind pine woods and
moors.</p>

<p class='c010'>A clear-cut line of cliffs, rising sheer
from the stretch of golden sands.</p>

<p class='c010'>Whirling white wings, as the gulls,
shrieking in hungry chorus, swooped to the
fringe of the outgoing tide.</p>

<p class='c010'>A narrow path, skirting the edge of the
cliffs, all among the pungent fragrance of
gorse and heather and yellow bracken.</p>

<p class='c010'>Along this path, on a warm September
evening, swung a solitary figure; a man
with sad eyes, feeling himself a blot upon
the landscape, yet drinking in every tint of
sunset glory, every wild wonder of snowy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_16'>16</span>wings, every whiff of crushed fragrance.
And, as he walked, the water down below
seemed to call to him in a silent chorus of
sparkling voices: “This is the way to the
City of Gold. Leap from the cliff! Take
to the waters! This, and this only, is your
road for Home.”</p>

<p class='c010'>It was the Lonely Man’s thirtieth birthday.
Nobody had wished him many happy
returns of the day. Nobody knew that it
was his birthday. He would not have
known it himself had it not been for the
soiled and faded label which he carried in
his pocket-book: <span class='sc'>Glass with care</span> printed
on one side; and, on the other, <span class='sc'>Returned
Empty</span>. Beneath the former was written,
in red ink: <cite>Luke xii. 6</cite>, beneath the latter:
<em>September 12, 1883</em>.</p>

<p class='c010'>This label had been tied to the helpless
bundle left, thirty years before, on a door-step
in a London suburb, one moonless
October night. The man-child, wailing
forlornly in the calico wrappings, was obviously
a month-old baby.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_17'>17</span>The matron of the Foundlings’ Institution,
to which a stalwart policeman carried
the bundle, after she had handed over the
infant to her most capable nurse to be
washed and clothed and fed, carefully proceeded
to examine the wrappings and the
label.</p>

<p class='c010'>The wrappings held no clue. No laundry
marks were on the strips of calico sheeting;
no fair linen or fine lace pointed to a
stealthy removal from a palatial mansion
to the cold comfort of the suburban door-step.
No jewelled locket held a young
mother’s wistful face, or a tress of golden
hair. The lonely baby had arrived in the
coarsest of unbleached calico sheeting. “Ten-three
a yard,” said the matron, and took
up the label.</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘Returned empty.’ Well, <em>that</em> he undoubtedly
was, bless his poor little tummy!
‘<em>September the 12th</em>.’ Just over a month
ago. That must be his birthday, poor mite!
‘Glass with care.’ Well, I never! They
might at least have chosen a label marked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_18'>18</span>‘Perishable.’ And what’s written here?
‘<cite>Luke xii. 6.</cite>’ They had better have left the
Bible out of their wrong-doings.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The matron was thorough in the search
for a possible clue. She fetched a Bible
and looked up the reference.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Are not five sparrows sold for two
farthings, and not one of them is forgotten
before God?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, I never!” said the matron. “So
they label that bonny boy a little worthless
sparrow!” The matron waxed eloquent in
her indignation. “This bit of flotsam on
life’s ocean, this helpless waif, flung in its
cheap wrappings on the mercy of strangers,
is valued by those who forsook it at less
than the Jewish half-farthing!”</p>

<p class='c010'>The chaplain had preached, quite lately,
on the fifth sparrow thrown in to make the
bargain. So, when he came for the christening,
and names must be given to the
nameless, remembering the sermon and the
label, the matron “named this child,” Luke
Sparrow.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_19'>19</span>Sometimes, laughing, they called him
“Little Glass with Care,” he was so easily
troubled, so sensitive to harsh sounds or
roughness of touch. His baby lip quivered
so readily; his dark eyes became deep pools
of silent misery. And in another sense he
was like a glass, during his babyhood. His
beautiful little face mirrored things not
seen. He would turn away from toys, and
lie gazing at the sunbeams or at as much
as could be seen of the sky through the
high windows; and sometimes he would
stretch out his arms to nothingness, and,
arching his little body, lift it almost off his
mattress, as if in response to some yearning
call of love.</p>

<p class='c010'>The first word he spoke was “Coming.”
He would shout: “Coming! Coming!”
when nobody had called. He turned, impatient,
from kind bosoms ready to cuddle
him; he slipped unresponsive from laps in
which he might have nestled softly, and
hurled himself where only hard boards received
<span class='pageno' id='Page_20'>20</span>him, or a cold wall bruised his baby
head.</p>

<p class='c011'>“‘Now we see as in a mirror enigmas,’”
quoted the matron, whose minister habitually
preached from the Revised Version.
“What are you trying to remember, you
queer little Bundle of Mystery? Who
calls, when you say ‘Coming’? What waiting
breast which is not here, makes you bump
your poor little head against the wall?”</p>

<p class='c010'>But, by the time he was three years old,
he had outlived even the matron’s tenderness.
His little heart opened to none of
them. His grave, sweet beauty grew repellent.
His solemn eyes looked past their
most persuasive danglings. Poor little “Returned
Empty”! His body throve under
their care. His spirit seemed to yearn for
something they could not give. He was a
lonely baby.</p>

<p class='c010'>Years went by. He outgrew the nursery,
and passed into the school. Steadily he
worked his way to the top of each class and
<span class='pageno' id='Page_21'>21</span>stayed there. He took very little account
of his school-fellows. The cruel could not
hurt him; the friendly failed to reach him.</p>

<p class='c011'>“First Prize: Luke Sparrow.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He made his graceful, solemn bow, and
took the book; but his dark eyes, undazzled
by the grand, gold chain, looked past the
portly Mayor, and failed to see the smile
of approval on the head-master’s face; his
ears were deaf to the plaudits of assembled
patrons and friends. He returned to his
place, hugging his book. Nobody asked
to see it; he shewed it to nobody. He was
a lonely little boy.</p>

<p class='c010'>He preferred study, involving solitude, to
games which hurled him among companions
of his own age. The chaplain took an interest
in the queerly brilliant little mind,
and gave the boy constant private coaching,
with the result that he won a Grammar
School scholarship, carrying advantages
which he could not have enjoyed at
the Foundlings’ Institution.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_22'>22</span>Two passions at this time began to possess
him, giving him his only thrills of
pleasure. The first was his love of the
water. He swam like a fish. The first time
he went with the other boys to the swimming
baths he stood on the edge watching
the swimmers; gazing, with brooding eyes,
at the water, as if striving to capture an
evasive memory.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Jump in, Sparrow!” shouted the young
master in charge. “There must always be
a beginning. Don’t funk it!”</p>

<p class='c010'>The lithe body quivered all over, a ripple
of muscles under the smooth skin. He
walked down the steps with the sudden
alertness of one awaking from a long
dream, slipped into the water, and, as it
lapped around him, glided forward and
swam from one end of the bath to the
other, with the ease and grace of a little
water animal.</p>

<p class='c010'>They called him the Frog. They called
him the Minnow. Later on, they called him
the Sea-lion. It mattered nothing to him
<span class='pageno' id='Page_23'>23</span>what they called him. He swam for the
sheer joy of it. He felt more alive in the
water than on land. He seemed to come
nearer to finding something he had been
seeking all his short life.</p>

<p class='c010'>His first swim in the sea brought the
swift resolve to eschew heaven. “Why?”
asked another boy, to whom in an unusual
moment of expansiveness he confided,
as they shared a towel, this momentous
decision. “Because,” said Luke, “once
we get there, the Bible says there shall be
no more sea.”</p>

<p class='c011'>His other passion was for gazing in at
windows, from the outside, after dark,
when firelight gleamed fitfully on shining
furniture; when unknown people sat talking,
and smiling, and handing each other
cups of tea; when they lighted lamps and
candles, forgetting to draw the curtains
and leaving the windows unshuttered.</p>

<p class='c010'>When he left school and was launched
on life, a lonely youth, to fend for himself,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_24'>24</span>earning enough by his pen for his own
modest needs, rousing himself to a few
hours of brilliant work if he wanted new
books, new clothes, or a complete holiday—this
strange fascination grew. A hunger
possessed him to look in at other people’s
windows. He would walk miles to satisfy
this craving. Out into the country, where
farm kitchens sent a ruddy glow across
the fields; where cottage windows gleamed
like friendly stars. He would draw near,
avoiding kennels and gravel paths, and
feast his eyes on cosy rooms; husbands and
wives, seated in easy chairs at the end of
the day’s work; fathers and mothers,
among their children; comfortable cats,
purring before the fire; faithful dogs, suddenly
alert, ears pricking, eyes on the window
pane.</p>

<p class='c010'>He had no wish to be within. His pleasure
was to look in from outside, as a being
from another world, with no personal share
in this life’s loves and joys, with an insatiable
desire to witness them.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_25'>25</span>Sometimes the inmates of these lighted
rooms chanced to look up and see the
strained face and sombre eyes gazing
through the window. Then they would
make a movement of fear or of anger; or a
kindly move, as if to ask him in. In either
case he would turn away quickly and disappear
in the darkness. He had no wish
to enter, he had no desire to share their joys.
He only asked to view them from without.</p>

<p class='c010'>Yet gradually the conviction grew within
him that this passion was a quest: that
some day he would look through a window
and see a room which should seem to him
that thing he had never known—Home.</p>

<p class='c010'>Grand interiors he saw, in London streets
and squares; glimpses of tasteful furniture,
art treasures, a suitable setting for perfectly
gowned grace and beauty; swiftly
concealed by the drawing of velvet curtains.</p>

<p class='c010'>It angered him that the illusive sense of
home drew nearer to him in these fitful
visions of wealth and loveliness than when
<span class='pageno' id='Page_26'>26</span>he looked into humbler and more simple
houses. All his sympathies were with those
who worked and toiled, living by the soil
and upon it.</p>

<p class='c010'>He liked the farmer who drank ale from
a brown jug, while his pleasant wife enjoyed
her dish of tea.</p>

<p class='c010'>Peering through area railings into the
basement of London houses, he liked the
stout cook who stood before a glowing
kitchen range, toasting-fork in hand, flinging
remarks over her portly print shoulder
to the pretty young housemaid, perched on
the kitchen table, swinging her feet and
darning a stocking.</p>

<p class='c010'>He loved the grey parrot with a naughty
eye, no doubt banished from the drawing-room
on account of its language, sidling up
and down its perch, in the cage under the
window. He felt sure it was making valuable
additions to its vocabulary, what time
the heat of the fire on one side and the
flippant attitude of the pretty housemaid
on the other, annoyed the stout cook.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_27'>27</span>He disliked the beautiful woman in the
room above, who reclined among silken
cushions, giving languid orders to a deferential
butler, then waved an impatient command
to the footman to draw the curtains.
Yet the drawing of those curtains shut out
the haunting sense of home, which had
grown within him as he watched the
woman among the silken cushions.</p>

<p class='c010'>He returned to his solitary rooms and
spent the evening writing an article in
which he decried the idle rich and extolled
the humble poor. Yet, while he wrote, he
wondered, half wistfully, who he might be
who had the right to come in and fill the
armchair drawn close to that couch of
silken cushions. He wondered this; and
wondering, ceased writing, lit his pipe and
took to dreaming.</p>

<p class='c010'>He was a lonely youth.</p>

<p class='c011'>By degrees his gift of descriptive writing
won him an acknowledged place in the
world of journalism. He was trusted by
<span class='pageno' id='Page_28'>28</span>an important newspaper to observe and
record various historic scenes in the great
metropolis—a royal funeral; a coronation;
the city’s welcome to a famous general.</p>

<p class='c010'>He wrote with a peculiar detachment,
never obtruding his own personality; viewing
events in their larger meaning, as well
as in careful completeness of minor detail;
yet with no throb of human sentiment, no
personal touch of intimate feeling.</p>

<p class='c010'>Later on, he went in a similar capacity
to India, and wrote one of the finest descriptions
on record of the royal Durbar.</p>

<p class='c010'>He moved amid scenes of varied interest;
he made many acquaintances, but no close
friends.</p>

<p class='c010'>His distant travels accomplished, he
would return to his comfortless rooms, and
work in solitude.</p>

<p class='c010'>That within him which might have responded
to love, and leapt into intimacy,
seemed shut away behind prison bars.
When Love drew near, he could but look
<span class='pageno' id='Page_29'>29</span>forth with haunted eyes, watching while
Love, rebuffed, moved sadly away.</p>

<p class='c010'>He was a lonely man.</p>

<p class='c011'>When he allowed himself a holiday, he
packed a small knapsack, went by the
fastest route possible to Scotland, Cornwall,
Devon or Norfolk—anywhere where
he could find a rugged coast; long stretches
of gorse and heather; villages, which he
could reach by nightfall.</p>

<p class='c010'>Each morning he would be on the shore
at sunrise, swimming, with strong, eager
strokes, up the golden path toward the
dazzling glory of the rising sun. Or, if
he chanced, at close of day, to find himself
where the coast faced westward, he would
slip into the water at sunset and glide, with
slow, dreamy motion and folded arms, up
the crimson way toward the setting sun.</p>

<p class='c010'>No day seemed complete to him unless it
began and ended in the sea.</p>

<p class='c010'>So, on this 12th of September, though
the sun was sinking behind distant moors,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_30'>30</span>when the waters called, he made his way
down the cliff, walked half a mile or so
along the shore until he found cover among
rocks; then swam swiftly out to sea, recapturing
the crimson ball as it disappeared
behind the pine woods.</p>

<p class='c010'>When he turned for a last sight of it, he
noticed a fine old house, standing castle-like
on the summit of the cliff, just above the
rocks beside which he had left his clothes.
It had not been in view when he had quitted
the high path for the beach and the lee
of the cliffs.</p>

<p class='c010'>He swam back to the shore, dressed,
lighted his pipe, and sat among the rocks
till twilight fell.</p>

<p class='c010'>The moon appeared, a huge yellow ball,
rising out of the sea.</p>

<p class='c010'>He found himself humming an old song
he had picked up the year before, while
on a walking tour through Brittany.</p>

<p class='c010'>The twilight deepened.</p>

<p class='c010'>Almost before he realised that he was

of the house he had seen from the sea.</p>

  <span class='pageno' id='Page_35'>35</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>SCENE II<br /> <span class='large'>THE UNEXPECTED WELCOME</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>A veranda, overhung by rambler
roses, ran the full length of the
front of the house.</p>

<p class='c010'>Through the diamond panes of low lattice
windows, the fitful glow of firelight
gleamed.</p>

<p class='c010'>The Lonely Man hesitated, half turned
away, then, drawn by an irresistible attraction,
stepped on to the veranda, stood
in the shadow, and looked in at a window.</p>

<p class='c011'>The room was so large, and its occupants
so far from the windows, that the silent
intruder had small need to fear detection.</p>

<p class='c010'>His first furtive glance into the interior
awakened, with a sudden throb, more
strongly than ever before, that illusive
sense of home.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_36'>36</span>He drew nearer.</p>

<p class='c010'>A long, low room; the many windows
running half the length of the veranda,
a cushioned window seat beneath them. A
door, on his left, opened on to the veranda.
At the opposite side of the room, another
door, standing ajar, led into a large hall.
At the top of the room, on his right, a log
fire burned in the huge fireplace. The
leaping flames illumined the oak panelling
and played on the carved beams in the ceiling.
Persian rugs, in soft tints of blue and
rose, lay upon the polished parquet.</p>

<p class='c010'>A couch, on the further side of the fireplace,
and at right-angles to it, faced the
windows. In the centre, opposite the
hearth, stood two large easy chairs.</p>

<p class='c010'>These chairs were occupied by a young
man in tweeds and shooting-boots—who
lay back luxuriously with legs outstretched,
as if long tramping in the heather had
earned him a welcome rest—and by a very
lovely girl, whose smiles and looks of happy
tenderness were divided between the sturdy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_37'>37</span>figure in the other chair, and a very small
boy in Highland dress, who darted to and
fro between them, trying to intercept a
ball as they threw it to one another; a brave
little figure, in tartan kilt and velvet jacket;
his brown curls tumbled, his dark eyes shining,
as he fell, over his father’s legs, headlong
into his mother’s lap.</p>

<p class='c010'>One casement stood open, and the lonely
watcher could hear their merry laughter
and the boy’s triumphant shout as he
snatched the ball from his mother’s hand.</p>

<p class='c010'>Holding it above his head, he danced out
into the middle of the room, in full view of
the windows.</p>

<p class='c010'>The watching eyes narrowed in puzzled
wonder.</p>

<p class='c010'>Why was that leaping figure so familiar?
The two in the chairs awakened no memories.
The lovely woman, with her fair
skin and coils of shining hair; the man,
long-limbed, freckled and ruddy—total
strangers both. Yet this child, who called
them “Father” and “Mother,” this little
<span class='pageno' id='Page_38'>38</span>dark head, brown, oval face, black, level
brows? Where had he met the imp before?</p>

<p class='c010'>His mind went back some twenty odd
years to the Christmas after his eighth
birthday. The kind Mayor had made a
feast at the Townhall for the children
from the Institution. They were given
funny dresses to wear. A Highland dress
was found for him, kilt and plaid and dirk
complete. The little black velvet jacket had
silver buttons with thistles on them. Some
ladies talked about him. They said: “With
those wonderful dark eyes and curls, he
should have come as the Black Prince.
Who is he?” They kissed him and gave
him chocolates. He hated being kissed;
but he liked the chocolates; and he liked
being called the Black Prince. At one end
of the hall there was a long mirror. He
slipped away and stood before it. He had
never before seen himself full length in a
mirror. He held the box of chocolates
above his head——</p>

<p class='c010'>Why—yes! This little boy with the ball
<span class='pageno' id='Page_39'>39</span>was an exact replica of the figure he had seen
reflected in the mirror; a replica of himself.</p>

<p class='c010'>He felt dizzy—shaken.</p>

<p class='c010'>He was turning away; but at that moment,
the hall beyond was illuminated.</p>

<p class='c010'>Something moved across it.</p>

<p class='c010'>A woman appeared in the open doorway—an
arresting figure—a woman with snow-white
hair, tall, stately, matronly; extraordinarily
beautiful, with a calm, melancholy
beauty; a woman well past middle age, yet
with soft white skin, unwrinkled; upright
carriage; a noble, gracious personality.</p>

<p class='c010'>“In the dark, children?” she said; then
put out her hand, and the room flashed
into light.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Grannie!” shouted the boy, and ran to
meet her.</p>

<p class='c010'>With her hand upon his shoulder, she
moved slowly into the middle of the room.</p>

<p class='c010'>The young man half rose, offering his
chair.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Do not move, Colin,” she said, and went
to the couch.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_40'>40</span>The boy climbed up beside her, nestling
his dark curls into the lace at her bosom.
She put her arm about him with a gesture
infinitely tender and protective.</p>

<p class='c010'>The younger woman spoke. “Colin and
I were lazing in the firelight, mother. Then
Nigel arrived with his ball, and forced us
to be energetic.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The watcher at the window pressed closer
to the pane. In the fascination of the scene
he forgot to fear discovery.</p>

<p class='c010'>By the brighter light the couple appeared
older than he had at first thought
them. She was probably his own age, even
older; her husband, two or three years her
senior. She had inherited her mother’s remarkable
beauty. It was good to see them
together. The one revealed the youthful
loveliness of the past; the other promised
the maturer beauty yet to come; and both
were very good to look upon.</p>

<p class='c010'>The man reclining in the chair between
them, gazed intently at his own boots. He
turned them from side to side, as the flame
<span class='pageno' id='Page_41'>41</span>played upon them, and examined them critically.
Then he thrust his hands deep into
his breeches’ pockets, stretched his long
legs to the fire, and stared at his boots with
whole-hearted admiration.</p>

<p class='c010'>For the first time in all the long years,
the Lonely Man without, yearned to be
within. His loneliness seized and shook
him. All his searching, all his watching, all
his hungry, forlorn hours, seemed to have
reached their culmination. This—this, at
last, was Home! Yet he stood outside, as
a watcher from another world; he had no
part nor lot in the love and comfort within.</p>

<p class='c010'>His yearning gaze was fixed upon the
central figure in the scene. Yes, she would
always be the central figure in any scene.
In court or cottage alike, she would be
queen.</p>

<p class='c010'>No wonder his little double dashed forward
when she said: “In the dark, children?”
If <em>that</em> voice could have called
him, when he was a lonely little boy, how
gladly he—who never came when he was
<span class='pageno' id='Page_42'>42</span>called—would have shouted “Coming!” and
flown to her embrace.</p>

<p class='c010'>He looked at the dark head, so like his
own, nestling against the softness of her
breast. He could see her bosom rise and
fall, in steady, rhythmic breathing, beneath
the little olive cheek. Dark lashes veiled
the bright brown eyes. Nigel was growing
sleepy. What wonder, in such “sweet security.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Nigel’s parents talked together.</p>

<p class='c010'>She sat silent, looking down at the small
face against her breast.</p>

<p class='c010'>It struck him that there was an aloofness
about her, a loneliness which almost
matched his own. Tragedy had laid its
mark upon that noble face; a sorrow borne
in patient silence; an agony unshared; a
grief too deep to be plumbed by human
sympathy.</p>

<p class='c010'>It seemed to the Lonely Man that his
loneliness would be easier to bear, for having
looked upon her; his “Returned Empty”
life would hold more possibility of fulness;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_43'>43</span>his “Glass with care” would be less sensitively
brittle, for having seen the mastered
tragedy in that calm face, crowned by the
silvered hair.</p>

<p class='c011'>One final look; then he must turn away
and be lost again in the outer darkness.</p>

<p class='c010'>His face was close against the glass. His
hungry eyes peered through.</p>

<p class='c010'>At that moment she raised her head,
looked straight across to the window, and
saw him.</p>

<p class='c010'>He could not move.</p>

<p class='c010'>He could not look away. Her eyes gazed
into his; right into his, and held them.</p>

<p class='c010'>She sat perfectly still.</p>

<p class='c010'>The hand stroking little Nigel’s leg,
paused.</p>

<p class='c010'>The boy’s lashes lay upon his cheek. He
stirred uneasily. The hand stroked again.</p>

<p class='c010'>Her face blanched to ashen whiteness;
then the delicate colour flooded it once more.</p>

<p class='c010'>Still her eyes held him.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_44'>44</span>At last her lips moved, silently. They
formed one word: “Wait.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Presently she rose.</p>

<p class='c010'>Nigel rubbed his eyes, leapt from the
sofa, and found his ball.</p>

<p class='c010'>She moved toward the window.</p>

<p class='c010'>The man without stepped back into the
shadow.</p>

<p class='c010'>Nigel had flung the ball at his mother,
and fallen over his father’s legs. The three
were laughing and shouting together.</p>

<p class='c010'>She came to the open casement, pushed
it wider, and leaned out.</p>

<p class='c010'>She spoke, very quietly, into the fragrant
darkness; the faintest whisper, yet he
heard.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I was expecting you”.... Her voice
was like the night-wind in the tops of the
pine trees; soft as a sigh, and full of mystery.
“Do not go.... You will find a
chair in the corner on your right. Wait
there until I am alone.”</p>

<p class='c010'>She drew back into the room, and closed
the casement.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_45'>45</span>He sank into the chair and sat there in
the silence, listening to the beating of his
heart. It sounded like heavy breakers
pounding upon the rocks below.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_49'>49</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>SCENE III<br /> <span class='large'>THE EXPECTED GUEST</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>He sat very still, and waited.</p>

<p class='c010'>He had miles to walk before
he could reach an inn; but food
and a night’s lodging seemed unnecessary
considerations in this strange hour.</p>

<p class='c010'>She had asked him to wait until she
should be alone; and he waited.</p>

<p class='c010'>A motor came to the other side of the
house; panted impatiently, for five minutes;
then sped away into the distance.</p>

<p class='c010'>He stood up and looked into the room.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was empty. Fresh logs had been
thrown upon the fire. The door into the
hall was shut.</p>

<p class='c010'>Even as he looked, it opened.</p>

<p class='c010'>An elderly butler appeared, walked forward
into the room, hesitated; then advanced
to the garden door, touched a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_50'>50</span>switch, and a couple of hanging lanterns
shed a soft light over the veranda. He
stood in the doorway, as if momentarily
uncertain; then saw the chair and its occupant
in the corner on his left, came over to
it and delivered his message, in deferential
tones, without lifting his eyes.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Her ladyship bids me say, sir, that dinner
will be served in half an hour. If you
will follow me, I will show you to your
room.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“To my room?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, sir. Her ladyship understood you
would be able to dine and sleep.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The butler moved to the door, held it
wide, and waited. There was nothing for
it, but to rise and enter.</p>

<p class='c010'>So the man who had all his life looked
in from without, now stepped over the
threshold and found himself within.</p>

<p class='c011'>Feeling keenly alive and yet as if moving
in a vivid dream, Luke Sparrow walked
<span class='pageno' id='Page_51'>51</span>across the room, and followed the butler
into the brightly-lighted hall, and up a
wide staircase.</p>

<p class='c010'>On a table in the hall stood a box of
library books, addressed with a brush, in
very black ink. Before he realised what
he was doing he had read the name—</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>

</div>

<p class='c010'>He repeated it to himself, as he mounted
the stairs. It awakened memories of Camelot.
He had never heard of it as a family
name; but it seemed in keeping with this
romance of an unexpected visit, as an
expected guest.</p>

<p class='c010'>At the top of the stairs the butler paused
to say: “Her ladyship desires that you will
please yourself, sir, as to whether you dress
or not.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Luke smiled. His knapsack held a clean
shirt, a razor, a comb, a toothbrush, and
half a dozen handkerchiefs.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am doing a walking tour,” he said.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_52'>52</span>“You might explain to her ladyship that I
have nothing with me but bare necessaries
in a small knapsack.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The butler opened a door, switched on the
light and stood aside that he might enter.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You will find all you need here, sir. The
door to the left leads into a bath-room. A
gong will sound at eight. It is now half-past
seven. If you should require anything
more, will you be so good as to ring, sir?”
He retired, closing the door softly behind
him.</p>

<p class='c010'>Luke looked around and laughed. He
wondered what on earth he could find to
ring for, which was not already there!</p>

<p class='c010'>He walked over to the dressing-table, on
which were silver-backed brushes, ivory
razors, silver-topped bottles!</p>

<p class='c010'>Laid out upon the bed was a complete
suit of dress clothes.</p>

<p class='c010'>If this was “Colin’s” room, he certainly
did himself well! If these were “Colin’s”
clothes, they certainly would not fit him!</p>

<p class='c010'>Laughing again—he who never laughed—he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_53'>53</span>turned to the bed, flung off his rough
Norfolk jacket, and slipped on the smooth
black coat with its silk lining. It fitted
him perfectly; and he was fastidious about
the cut of his clothes.</p>

<p class='c010'>Should he?... Not he! He would never
wear another man’s garments. He would
never stand in another man’s shoes. If
Lady Tintagel asked him to dine, she must
have him as he was. If the lovely daughter
looked askance at him, she must learn
to understand that you don’t carry a dress
suit in a knapsack.</p>

<p class='c010'>But the bath? Yes, rather! That was
quite another matter. His long sea swims
had made him feel like a kipper.</p>

<p class='c010'>What a bath-room! Every muscle relaxed
in the steaming hot water. A bottle
of fragrant aromatic stuff stood, temptingly
handy. He poured it in, and luxuriated.
“Colin” must feel a god, with all this at his
command, whenever he came in fagged. He
must descend on his admiring womenfolk,
like a giant refreshed.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_54'>54</span>A cold shower—and then he blessed
heaven he had put a clean shirt in his
knapsack.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Colin’s” ivory-handled razors made
shaving a positive pastime.</p>

<p class='c010'>One moment of indecision, as he caught
sight of the dress suit upon the bed. Strange
that it should fit. He remembered the
beautiful rooms downstairs. He would be
decidedly out of the picture in his tweeds.
He remembered the full-length mirror at
the Mayor’s party. “He should have come
as the Black Prince.” How he had enjoyed
the remark! His first lesson in vanity.
He smiled to think how often he had repeated
it to himself, and postured in his
shabby little suits. Do people realise how
inordinately vain a small boy can be?...
Should he? No! That was a fancy-dress
masquerade; and so would this be. Whatever
anybody said, whatever anybody
thought, he must meet Lady Tintagel clad
at least in the raiment of his own self-respect
and independence. It was not as
<span class='pageno' id='Page_55'>55</span>though he had arrived soaked through and
had had to borrow dry things. He brushed
his old tweeds vigorously with “Colin’s”
silver-backed clothes-brush.</p>

<p class='c010'>A gong boomed sonorously through the
house.</p>

<p class='c010'>As he walked down the stairs he was
still thinking, with dream-like persistence,
of the dress difficulty. “I shall say: ‘Excuse
this rig. One travels light on a walking
tour.’”</p>

<p class='c010'>In the hall the butler waited.</p>

<p class='c010'>“This way, sir.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_59'>59</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>SCENE IV<br /> <span class='large'>THE PRISON BARS DISSOLVE</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>Lady Tintagel was alone.</p>

<p class='c010'>She stood at the far end of the
drawing-room.</p>

<p class='c010'>When he entered she was leaning against
the mantelpiece, looking down into the fire.</p>

<p class='c010'>She turned, still gripping the marble edge
with her left hand.</p>

<p class='c010'>She wore a gown of trailing black velvet
and stood on a white Angora rug.</p>

<p class='c010'>Miles of rose carpet lay between him and
the fireplace.</p>

<p class='c010'>He seemed to be walking uphill, as he
came toward her.</p>

<p class='c010'>When he reached the rug at last, he and
she seemed to be standing together on the
summit of a delectable mountain. His
mind still ran on his unsuitable attire, but
he forgot the sentence he had prepared.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_60'>60</span>“I couldn’t,” was his lame apology.</p>

<p class='c010'>She looked at him, and smiled. “<em>You</em>—wouldn’t,”
she said.</p>

<p class='c010'>There was such complete understanding
in the grave regard of her kind eyes, in
the low tones of her voice, so sweet and
full of music.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was all strangely intimate. As he stood
beside her, lines he had heard years before
flashed into his mind.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“Two men looked out through prison bars;</div>
      <div class='line'>One saw mud; the other, stars.”</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>Hitherto he had seen mud—always mud.
In her presence he realised the possibility
of seeing stars—undreamed of stars.</p>

<p class='c010'>And his prison bars themselves seemed
vanishing.</p>

<p class='c010'>Something captive in him broke its chains
and leapt out into liberty.</p>

<p class='c010'>And still she spoke no word; but her
eyes dwelt on him with that all-enveloping,
comprehending look of tenderness.</p>

<p class='c010'>An unspoken sentence seemed to hang
<span class='pageno' id='Page_61'>61</span>suspended. The silence was tense with it,
as when a great orchestra, ready to sound
the opening strain of a mighty symphony,
waits, with eye, hand, and ear alert, for
the first beat of the lifted baton.</p>

<p class='c010'>But, on the instant, came an anti-climax.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Dinner is served, my lady,” announced
a deferential voice.</p>

<p class='c010'>She laughed. “I suppose one <em>must</em> eat,”
she said; and his common sense wondered
why she said it, and why the same thought,
unspoken, had been in his own mind.</p>

<p class='c010'>She laid her hand within his arm, and
they moved slowly down the room together.
Walking so with her, he noted that
she was slightly taller than he. She leaned
on him. He felt vividly alive. Where
was his shell—his shell of morbid reserve,
in which he had hidden himself since his
babyhood?</p>

<p class='c010'>He tried to ask her how it came about
that she had been expecting him; but something
restrained the question.</p>

<p class='c010'>He wanted to tell her all about himself,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_62'>62</span>right from the beginning; all he had
thought, and felt, and suffered; his shrinking
from intimacy with his fellow-men;
his loneliness; his shameful habit—he knew,
now, that it was shameful—of looking in,
unseen, at other people’s windows, his half-unconscious
belief that some day he would
look in, out of the darkness, and see a room
which his spirit would acclaim as home;
and how, to-day—at last—But he could not
tell her that! Yes, he could! He could
tell her anything. She would understand.
And, when his confession was over, he
would kneel before her—as a tired little
boy might kneel at his mother’s knees at
bedtime—and say his prayers. Then she
would lay her hands upon his head, and
Divine forgiveness and benediction would
be his.</p>

<p class='c010'>They were crossing the hall. The butler
stood at the dining-room door.</p>

<p class='c010'>“After dinner,” she said, “you must tell
me all.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_65'>65</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>SCENE V<br /> <span class='large'>“I HAVE WAITED SO LONG!”</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>The round table was laid for two.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I thought——” he said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Colin and Eva? No; their
home is twelve miles from here. They were
spending the afternoon with me. I live
alone.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I thought I was using your son-in-law’s
room.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No,” she said, “oh, no! That room——”
she paused. “The room you used—is my
husband’s dressing-room. Since I lost him,
it has been kept exactly as he left it. For
over thirty years it has looked, each day,
just as if he had used it the day before.
It did not give you the feeling of a disused
apartment?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No,” he said; “I thought——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You thought it was Colin’s? No; Colin
<span class='pageno' id='Page_66'>66</span>has never been into that room. In fact,
none enter there. It is a sanctuary of
mine.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Her beautiful eyes were on his face as
she said the words, full of an expression
which he failed to fathom. He wondered
why he should have been ushered into a
sanctuary forbidden to others. Yet was he
not, also, prepared to admit her into the
sanctuary of his inner life, to which none
had ever gained admission?</p>

<p class='c010'>The presence of the old man-servant, who
did not leave the room, restrained more
intimate conversation. He found himself
wondering what they would say when at
last they were really alone.</p>

<p class='c010'>She talked of the beauty of the surrounding
country; the wild hills, the heather;
the pine woods, full of health-giving fragrance.</p>

<p class='c010'>He told her of his walking tours.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is the only holiday I care for; to
walk and walk, alone with Nature, from
sunrise to sunset. Usually I reach an inn,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_67'>67</span>by nightfall; but it does not trouble me
if I don’t. On warm nights, I would just
as soon sleep in the open.” He looked up,
with the rare smile which softened his face
into extraordinary sweetness. “I am
afraid you are harbouring a tramp, Lady
Tintagel.”</p>

<p class='c010'>She met the smile with her own. “Am
I?” Her voice dropped very low. “My
tramp has tramped a long way to reach
harbour.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“A long way? I seem to have been walking
all my life, just that I might reach here
to-night.”</p>

<p class='c010'>With a swift movement, she leaned forward
and laid her hand on his.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Wait!” she said.</p>

<p class='c010'>It was the first time she had touched his
hand with hers.</p>

<p class='c010'>An unexpected emotion awoke within
him. It was as if she had pressed an electric
switch, as he had seen her do when entering
the darkening room. His inner
being seemed flooded with light. His cold,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_68'>68</span>patient apathy quickened suddenly into impatience.
He forgot conventions. He lost
control of himself. He threw common
sense to the winds. He caught the hand
she had withdrawn, and gripped it.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I can’t wait,” he said. “I have waited
so long. I want to talk to you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He felt like a headstrong boy who refuses
to be good. He felt like a lover who suddenly
gives way to the desire, cost what it
may, to master his mistress. He felt like
a drowning man catching at a rope. He
felt like nothing he had ever felt before.
And it soothed him to see this stately
woman quiver and turn pale. Serve her
right! What was she doing to him? Why
did her touch go to his brain like the instant
intoxication of champagne to a starving
man? He felt reckless. Devil take the
consequences! He couldn’t play-act any
more.</p>

<p class='c010'>She rose at once. His obvious emotion
restored her self-control.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Come,” she said, quietly. Then, to the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_69'>69</span>old man-servant, discreetly busying himself
at the sideboard: “Serve the fruit and
coffee in the Oak Room, Thomas.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Even while he blindly followed her,
Luke felt a moment of surprise that the
order received no deferential acknowledgment.
He glanced at the man. Tears were
running down his furrowed cheeks.</p>

<p class='c010'>Strange—even where all was strange.
Why should their emotion move this carefully
trained automaton?</p>

<p class='c010'>Lady Tintagel took up a wrap as they
passed through the hall, went straight
through the Oak Room, and out at the
door leading on to the veranda.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_73'>73</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>SCENE VI<br /> <span class='large'>“SUNSET AND EVENING STAR”</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>The moon had mounted into the
heavens, and now cast a path of
silver light across the sea.</p>

<p class='c010'>They stood together looking down upon
it.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I came that way,” he said. “The waters
called me from the cliff top at sunset. I
walked along the shore for half a mile or
so, then found some handy rocks, stripped
in their shelter, and swam out, far and fast,
until the sun rose again, for me, behind
the pine woods. As I swam back to shore
I saw this house, for the first time. Later
I found the zigzag path, climbed it, and
stood upon the lawn. Twilight had fallen
suddenly; a chill was in the air. I saw
the fitful glow of firelight through the
windows. The darkness came so quickly,
I did not fear detection. I crossed the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_74'>74</span>lawn and stood on the veranda. I watched
the three at play by the log fire. The room
grew darker. I turned to go. Then you
came in, and flashed all into light. I stayed—you
bid me stay. And here I am. But I
came to you, in the sunset, from the sea.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I thought as much,” she said. “‘Sunset
and evening star, and one clear call for me.’
Do you know Tennyson’s great crowning
poem? Will you repeat it as we stand
here? It was so strongly in my mind as I
watched the sunset. I think that was why
I was so sure you would come to-night.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, I know the lines,” he answered.
“They have always held for me an extraordinary
appeal. But how came you to be
expecting me—to-night, or any night?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Repeat them. We have all the night for
questions; but this moment will not come
again.”</p>

<p class='c010'>She slipped her hand within his arm. He
laid his own upon it and did as she asked.
And, as he repeated Tennyson’s noble lines,
the tumult within his spirit ceased.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_75'>75</span>The stillness, all about them, was complete;
broken only by the music of his voice.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>

    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>Sunset and evening star,</div>

      <div class='line in2'>When I have crost the bar.</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>A long silence. Then: “I have no pilot,”
he said. “I drift rudderless. I am bound
to make shipwreck on the bar.”</p>

<p class='c010'>She did not seem to hear his words. Her
mind was far away. Her eyes were on the
sea, gazing upon that path of shimmering
light.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nigel,” she said, “there <em>was</em> no farewell—no
<span class='pageno' id='Page_76'>76</span>farewell, belovèd; but oh, the dark—the
dark—the dark!”</p>

<p class='c010'>He wondered to whom she spoke. He
tightened his hold upon her hand and stood
silent.</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘The Lord gave and the Lord hath
taken away.’ Each evening I stood here
and said those words. If I could have
added: ‘Blessed be the Name of the Lord,’
the darkness might have lightened. But I
could not; and it still was dark.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He asked himself what awful memory of
sorrow brought that horror of anguish to
her face. But the moment kept him silent.
He could not speak.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, cruel sea!” she moaned. “You took
my All—my All.”</p>

<p class='c010'>She shivered, and he folded her wrap
more closely around her.</p>

<p class='c010'>Then she turned to him, and the look of
anguish passed. There was gladness in her
eyes.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Come in,” she said. “Let us come in;
and shut the door.”</p>

<div class='chapter'>

  <h2 class='c005'>SCENE VII<br /> <span class='large'>“AND AFTER THAT—THE DARK”</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>“Now,” said Lady Tintagel, as he
put down his empty coffee-cup,
“you may talk. There is no
further need to wait.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I want to tell you things from the beginning,”
he said. “Will it bore you if I begin
at the beginning?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You could not bore me; and I would not
miss one moment of the beginning. Tell
me all.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“My name is Luke Sparrow, so named by
the matron of the Foundlings’ Institution
to which I was carried when a month old,
or thereabouts, by the arm of the Law. I
began life on a door-step—a suburban door-step.
I have never known home, or kith,
or kin. Like Melchisedec of old, I am
without father, without mother, without
<span class='pageno' id='Page_80'>80</span>descent; but there the resemblance ends;
for Melchisedec was King of Salem, which
is King of Peace, whereas I, from my infancy,
have been possessed by a most restless
demon. I was ‘Returned Empty’ and
marked ‘Glass with Care’——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Returned empty?” There was horror
in her voice. “What—what <em>do</em> you mean?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The label,” he said; “the label pinned
to the unwanted bundle had, printed in
bold letters, on one side: <span class='sc'>Returned Empty</span>,
under which somebody who knew it, had
written, presumably, the date of my birth.
On the other side was printed <span class='sc'>Glass with
Care</span>, beneath which the same careful person
had taken the trouble to write a Bible
reference, most explicitly explaining the exact
value of the said bundle: <cite>Luke xii. 6</cite>.
‘Are not five sparrows sold for two farthings?’
This apt quotation inspired the matron,
on christening Sunday, to bestow upon
me the name of Luke Sparrow. She
was a good woman and meant well. But
<span class='pageno' id='Page_81'>81</span>it was, ever after, a standing joke at the
institution.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not one of them is forgotten before
God,” said Lady Tintagel.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, I know. But the close of the verse
did not appear to be applicable, the bundle
not containing a genuine sparrow but merely
a lonely little human child, ‘Returned
Empty.’”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Returned?” she said; “Empty!” There
was tragedy in her voice.</p>

<p class='c010'>He laughed. “Yes; <em>very</em> empty—so the
nurses said. Well, it was a bad beginning.
The physical emptiness was soon remedied;
but the mental and spiritual void remained
unfilled. I’ve lived an utterly lonely life;
and the misery of it was, I didn’t seem
able to accept companionship; I had no
capacity for friendship, no wish for homelife.
I have always been seeking, seeking,
seeking for something I could not find.
Lots of people wanted to be friendly; heaps
of people tried to be kind; but I could not
take their friendship, or accept their kindness.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_82'>82</span>To misquote a well-known saying,
I was ‘<em>in</em> the world but not <em>of</em> the world.’
And then I had a vice.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“A vice?” Her eyes, which never left
his face, darkened with apprehension.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes; a vice. Oh, not drink, or drugs,
or other depravity. I have kept my body
sane and clean, and without much effort
either. I love the sea too well, and swim
in it too often, for any form of moral
squalor to have a chance.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Squalor!” she exclaimed, with a fine
disdain. “<em>You</em> would have had no need for
squalor, you beautiful boy! All women
must have loved you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Boy?” He laughed. “Good Lord! I
was never a boy! I was born with a
grown-up soul. Yes, they were kind; but I
wanted none of their kindness. All women
were to me mere shadows. Love never
called to me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The vice?” she said. “What was it?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“A mental thing. A morbid craving to
look on at other people’s joys; to view
<span class='pageno' id='Page_83'>83</span>them, without sharing them; an absolute
hunger to see home life, though I had none
of my own. This led me into the low-down
practice of prowling about after dark, peering
in at lighted windows, like a lonely
soul from another world, spying on bliss
he might not share. I began it as quite a
little chap, peeping and running away. The
passion grew as I grew. When my day’s
work was over, I would walk miles to stalk
unshuttered windows. Many a time I have
narrowly escaped being run in as a probable
burglar. Many a fright I have given to
innocent people who looked up suddenly and
surprised my uncanny face pressed against
the glass. I know now what I was seeking.
In some sub-conscious part of me I knew
that somewhere in the world was a window
through which I should look and see at last
a room which would be <span class='fss'>HOME</span>.</p>

<p class='c010'>“So I prowled on. I was prowling to-night.
But I never before wanted to be
invited to enter. I preferred to be outside.
And—until to-night—I never realised what
<span class='pageno' id='Page_84'>84</span>a low-down habit it was. To my morbid
emptiness it seemed no wrong toward happy
people, that I should just look upon their
joys.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“But why—to-night?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ah, because all is different. You have
done something to me; I don’t know what,
or why. Something in your sub-consciousness
must have reached mine. You have
burst the bars of my prison and set my
spirit free. I shall leave here and go back
to the world, a man among men. Hitherto
I have felt—do you know the weird Schubert
song?—a Doppelgänger. Good Lord,
the horror of it! But you have broken
the spell. I don’t know how you did it.
Perhaps it was because you asked me
in.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why did you come in?” she whispered:
“You, who always preferred to remain outside.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Dare I tell you?” he asked. “Will you
think it awful cheek? It was because—at
last—at last—it was Home.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_85'>85</span>The woman on the couch opened wide her
arms and leaned toward him with a movement
of extraordinary tenderness. Her
face was illumined by a radiance almost
unearthly in its sublime joy.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It <em>was</em> Home,” she said. “It <em>is</em> Home.
Ah, do you not remember, belovèd? Never
call yourself Luke Sparrow again. Never
call yourself a foundling—you, whom I
have found at last! I can tell you your
name, if there be still need to tell it: Nigel
Guido Cardross Tintagel.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What?” The blood leapt into his face.
His outstretched hands almost met hers.
“Are you—are <em>you</em>—my mother?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, belovèd, no! Oh, Nigel, think
again! Remember! You <em>must</em> remember!”</p>

<p class='c010'>His hands clutched his knees. He looked
full into her eyes; a long, steady gaze.</p>

<p class='c010'>At last: “I remember nothing,” he said.
“You will have to tell me. I would to God
you were my mother. But, if that may not
be, then—in Heaven’s name—what are you
to me?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_86'>86</span>Her voice was a pæan of triumphant joy.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am your wife.”</p>

<p class='c011'>The man in the chair sat before her,
petrified. His hands gripped his knees.
Twice he essayed to speak; but no sound
would pass his lips.</p>

<p class='c010'>At length: “Great God!” he said: “Am
I mad, or are you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nigel,” she said, “my dearest, you have
come back to me. My boundless love, my
desperate grief, my passionate prayers,
have brought you back to me. My lover,
my husband, my heart’s dearest, try to
remember!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I remember nothing,” he said. “This
is the madness of a strange, wild dream.
Presently I shall wake and find myself lying
on golden bracken, while the dawn
breaks in the east, and the stars pale in the
sky. I have dreamed this dream before. I
shall wake. It will mean losing you; but I
<em>must</em> wake.” He leapt to his feet and
shouted the last words; “I <em>must</em> wake!”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_87'>87</span>“Hush, my dearest, hush!” She spoke
as if soothing a startled child. “Sit down,
and I will explain. I can make all clear,
if you will listen patiently. To you it is
startling. But I have waited so long; I
have known so long that you were coming.
Sit down and listen. Striding about the
room will not wake you, because this is no
dream. It is blessed, blessed reality. Listen,
Nigel! Listen, belovèd! I will make
it all quite clear.”</p>

<p class='c010'>She rose, poured out a glass of wine and
brought it to him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Drink this. How your hand shakes!...
No; I will not touch you; but I beg of you
to drink it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>She crossed the room, unlocked a bureau,
took from it a despatch-box and placed it
beside her on the couch.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Now help me to tell you by listening
calmly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We had three years of most perfect
married life. No woman ever had such a
lover, such a husband, as you were to me.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_88'>88</span>No man was ever so adored by his wife
as you were by me. We were old enough
to understand our happiness and to take it
to the full. I was twenty-eight and you
were thirty when I lost you; but you were
so gloriously young, so full of life and love
and laughter. I used to say you would
never grow up. Sometimes I felt like wife
and mother in one, my heart overflowing
with the tenderness of both. Yet you were
so wise and strong and grandly good. In
all things spiritual and mental I leaned on
you and learned of you.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We had one little daughter, a year old
on that fatal 12th of August; but, dear
though she was to us both, you were my
All. My whole body and soul were yours,
wrapped up in you. And your love for me
was such a sweet deep mystery of tenderness
that I scarce dared think of it, save
when you were near me. Surely it is given
to few to love as we loved, to experience
what we experienced.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We lived much in the open; riding,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_89'>89</span>walking, climbing together. You were a
magnificent swimmer and loved the sea.
Often at dawn, on a summer morning, you
would leave our bed, dash down to the
shore, and swim up the golden pathway,
straight toward the rising sun.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Our room is over this one. Our windows
open on to a broad balcony running
along the top of the veranda. There a
powerful telescope is mounted.</p>

<p class='c010'>“My heart always failed me over these
early swims. You were so far from the
shore, out in the ocean; no possible help at
hand. I used to watch you through the
telescope, and, knowing this, you would
turn and smile and wave to me and speak
my name. Often you dived into the bottomless
deep of waters. Then your anxious
wife could see nothing but an expanse of
sky and ocean. After what seemed an hour
of suspense, you would re-appear in the
sparkling ripples, laughing, shaking the salt
water from your eyes, and bounding along
with the strength and grace of a splendid
<span class='pageno' id='Page_90'>90</span>sea-lion. Then I would breathe again and
slip back to bed as you neared the shore
and I lost you under the lee of the cliff.</p>

<p class='c010'>“But, when you came back to my arms,
I used to hold you close to my beating heart
and say: ‘Oh, Nigel, my dearest! Some day
those treacherous waters will swallow you
up, and you will come back to me no more.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘I shall always come back to you, my
sweet,’ you would make answer. ‘If I lay
fifty fathoms deep, and <em>you</em> called, I should
hear and come back.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then you would quite suddenly fall
asleep; but I would keep vigil, praying
Heaven that you might never lie fifty fathoms
deep, and loving the salt on my lips,
as I softly kissed your damp hair.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nigel, do you remember?”</p>

<p class='c010'>The man in the chair put out his hand,
groping blindly for the glass, and moistened
his lips before he made answer.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I remember nothing,” he said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“One lovely August evening we sat together
on the shore. It was our baby’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_91'>91</span>birthday. She was a year old. It had been
a happy, merry day. We had been up to
the nursery, where, surrounded by soft,
furry toys, she slept. We stood together
on either side of her crib, looking down at
the rose-petal face with its aureola of tumbled
golden hair.</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘Nothing of the Italian there,’ you remarked.
Your dark colouring and vivid
vitality came from an Italian grandfather
on your mother’s side, from whom you also
took your second name.</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘I want a little Guido, some day,’ I
whispered, as we turned away.</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘All in good time,’ you answered, laughing
softly, and slipped your arm through
mine.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We strolled down to the beach and
watched a blood-red sunset.</p>

<p class='c010'>“A sudden wind arose, gusty and fitful,
blowing countless little white caps across
the bay.</p>

<p class='c010'>“A French woman, who, with her two
daughters, had taken a hunting lodge near
<span class='pageno' id='Page_92'>92</span>by for the season, joined us on the beach.
We found them pleasant neighbours, vivacious
and amusing. Madame de Villebois
had walked along the shore. ‘<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Mes filles</span></i>’
were out sailing, in their little ‘<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">barquette à
voile</span></i>.’ Presently it leapt into view, rounding
the point; a pretty picture in the sunset
glow.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Seated upon the rocks just below this
cliff, we watched the tiny skiff dancing and
curtseying toward the middle of our bay.</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘Gusty for sailing,’ you remarked; and
the next moment we could see that they
were in difficulties. The sail flapped loose,
then bellied suddenly, and the boat lurched.</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘Oh, Sir Nigel,’ cried madame, with
clasped hands, ‘bring out your rowing boat
and go to help them!’</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘I’m awfully sorry,’ you said; ‘but the
boat is under repairs.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“At that instant the sail belched again;
the girls stood up; the skiff heeled over,
and they were flung into the water.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then followed a pandemonium of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_93'>93</span>screaming. Madame shrieked, and flew to
the water’s edge, crying: ‘Sir Nigel, save
them! Save them! <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Oh, mon Dieu! Mes
enfants!</span></i>’</p>

<p class='c010'>“The girls screamed in the water, catching
at the bottom of the upturned boat.
They could swim enough just to keep their
heads above water. Their shrieks of terror
were appalling.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You flung off your coat and dashed
down the beach in your flannels.</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘Keep madame out of the sea, darling,’
you shouted out to me, as I ran behind you.
‘I will bring the girls in, one at a time.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“I put my arms round the frantic mother,
and we stood together watching you.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Even in such a moment, my heart
thrilled at sight of your magnificent swimming,
as you forged through the waves at almost
incredible speed. It did not occur to me
to be afraid. Often, when I had misjudged
my strength or been caught by the current,
you had brought me safely to shore, swimming
on your back with one arm around
<span class='pageno' id='Page_94'>94</span>me, while I lay on your chest in perfect
security, hearing your voice close to my
ear, saying: ‘All right, my darling! We
can’t sink. Breathe, and rest, and trust
yourself to me.’ These slim French girls
would be nothing, compared with my
height and weight.</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘He will save them easily, madame,’ I
said. ‘Keep calm. He will bring them in,
one at a time.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“The frantic screams of the girls became
more ear-piercing. I had never heard a
sound so appalling.</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘Hold on!’ you shouted. ‘Hold on!
I am coming! Hold on!’</p>

<p class='c010'>“Just before you reached them, one lost
her grip of the boat; it slipped away from
her clinging fingers, and, turning, she
swam and struggled toward you. In an instant
you had her by the arm, holding
her up.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I remember wondering why she did not
cease screaming. You were evidently reasoning
<span class='pageno' id='Page_95'>95</span>with her and trying to draw her on
to your chest.</p>

<p class='c010'>“At that moment the other girl left the
boat, swam up behind you, and clasped you
frantically round the throat.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You let go of the first, in order to seize
those throttling fingers; but she caught at
your wrists and held them.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Instantly you all went under, in a churning
mass; then came to the surface—you
fighting desperately—only to disappear
again.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then, for one instant I saw a brown
hand appear, pointing heavenward; a girl’s
white fingers locked around the wrist.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then that also vanished, and nothing
remained, but the boat, drifting bottom
upwards, and the fainting French woman
in my arms.</p>

<p class='c010'>“My Man, my Life, my All, lay drowning
fathoms deep in the treacherous, cruel
sea, while I stood helpless on the shore.</p>

<hr class='c013' />

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_96'>96</span>“When the precious body was recovered
a week later, those gripping fingers had to
be cut from throat and wrists, that it might
lie alone in the graveyard on the hill. I
was not allowed to see It; so my last
memory of my Darling was that vision
of him in his glorious strength, as he
swam through the waters, with no thought
of personal danger, shouting to the drowning
girls: ‘Hold on! I am coming!’</p>

<p class='c010'>“And, when the chill waters of my own
despair threatened to engulf me, I seemed
to hear again those ringing tones: ‘Hold
on! <span class='sc'>I am Coming!</span>’</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then something happened which gave
them a new meaning, and awakened in my
own mind a train of thought which surely
saved my reason.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Your will was found, leaving all you
possessed to me, and with it a letter addressed:
‘<em>To my wife: for her eye alone.</em>’</p>

<p class='c010'>“I had been so haunted by the remembrance
of that right hand, pointing skyward
from the sea, and now I was to receive
<span class='pageno' id='Page_97'>97</span>a message, penned by those precious
fingers, which should indeed point out a
ray of hope in the black sky of my sunless
future.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nigel, do you remember?”</p>

<p class='c011'>The man in the chair slipped his brown
hands into the pockets of his coat. He did
not lift his eyes from the floor.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I remember nothing,” he said, very low.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Then I must shew you your letter,
which no eye save my own has ever seen.”</p>

<p class='c010'>She unlocked the despatch-box, took
from it a small jewel-case, opened this with
a gold key hanging from a chain around
her wrist; then, from a sealed envelope,
drew some half-dozen sheets of closely
written manuscript. Leaning forward, she
held them toward him.</p>

<p class='c010'>Slowly, with evident reluctance, the lean
brown hand came out of the coat pocket.</p>

<p class='c010'>He took them from her, and let his eyes
rest on the first page.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_98'>98</span>There followed moments of tense silence.</p>

<p class='c010'>The tall clock, in a corner of the room,
ticked loudly.</p>

<p class='c010'>Out seaward, a nightbird screeched.</p>

<p class='c010'>An owl in the fir wood behind the house,
hooted thrice.</p>

<p class='c010'>The fire fell together, and shot up
tongues of flame.</p>

<p class='c010'>At last he lifted hunted eyes to her face.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is my handwriting,” he said, “or
something very like it. But it is dated August
12th, 1882, thirteen months before my
birth.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Read it,” said Lady Tintagel.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I cannot.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You must.”</p>

<p class='c010'>She rose, placed a shaded electric lamp
on the table at his elbow; then switched off
all other lights.</p>

<p class='c010'>Seated in shadow on the couch, she
watched the dark face, so fine in its stern
intentness, bending over the paper; the
strong, nervous hand waiting to turn each
<span class='pageno' id='Page_99'>99</span>page; the dark hair, from which no cropping
could cut the curl.</p>

<p class='c010'>“God in heaven,” she sighed, “he has
come back to me in answer to the insistence
of my frantic prayer; but he has returned
emptied of all memory. Oh, of
Thine infinite mercy, let there rise in his
mind the floodtide of remembrance.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Thus she prayed and yearned and hoped,
while the man in the chair slowly read the
letter, written, in his own handwriting, a
year before his birth.</p>

</div>

<p class='c010'>“You and I are so full of happy, buoyant
life, that it seems a strange anomaly that I
should sit down to write to you of death:
we are so intimately one in heart and mind,
so wedded in each moment of our perfect
life together, that there seems no need to
face the possibility of parting. Yet, lately,
there has come to me a chill presentiment
that, in the very midst of life and joy, a
<span class='pageno' id='Page_100'>100</span>sudden death may come with one swift
stroke; that you and I, belovèd, counting
on fifty blissful years together, may, in one
fatal moment, be wrenched apart.</p>

<p class='c010'>“So I have made my will, leaving everything
to you. All is in order. Fergusson
will manage the estate. Thomas and his
wife can be wholly trusted in the house. I
leave my wife in faithful hands.</p>

<p class='c010'>“So much for outward things. But what
can I say to comfort you, my Love, my
Own, in the utter loneliness of heart and
soul, which will, alas, be yours when you
read this?</p>

<p class='c010'>“Try to realise that we are not lost to
one another.</p>

<div class='lg-container-b c012'>
  <div class='linegroup'>
    <div class='group'>
      <div class='line'>“‘Nothing can untwine</div>
      <div class='line'>Thy life from mine.’</div>
    </div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>“We are eternally one, belovèd. Time is
made up of uncertainties; not so Eternity.
‘<em>Lord, Thou hast been our Dwelling Place
in all generations.</em>’ When we pass out of
Time, we just go home again to that safe
<span class='pageno' id='Page_101'>101</span>Dwelling Place. We are so safe in Eternity.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And our love, yours and mine, being
eternal, we shall find one another again.
Don’t think of me as dead. Think of me as
more vividly alive than ever; yours still;
always wholly, utterly yours.</p>

<p class='c010'>“But, my belovèd, however hard you find
it to bear the sudden silence, however much
you long for just one word, one sign—never
turn to a spiritualistic medium, or to spiritualism
in any form. I hold that thing to be
a most damnable device of the Devil’s for
bamboozling the minds of men; leading
stricken hearts to believe they are holding
converse with their Dead, when, in reality,
demons intervene and whisper foolish nothings,
till they trap the soul, confuse the
mind, and wreck the moral and spiritual
life. <em>Better a holy silence, than a lying
whisper.</em> Better a parting bravely borne in
faith and patience, than an attempt to
bridge the chasm by forbidden means.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yet we <em>may</em> meet again on earth, if it
be God’s will for us, before we spend our
<span class='pageno' id='Page_102'>102</span>great Eternity together. We have often
talked of this. You know how firmly we
believe that we have met before, in other
times, in other climes; that we have lived
and loved, striven together, risen together
to God’s great purposes of fresh development.
We may yet meet again in Time;
find each other, know each other; ‘rise, on
stepping-stones of our dead selves, to higher
things.’ Many adventures into Time may
be necessary to our full completion for
Eternity. Remember all we have said of
this subject, and do not think of Death as
the end. It is but a passing on to fuller
life, to fresh beginnings, to greater opportunities.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Of course we must bear in mind that
all this is necessarily speculative. We cannot
dogmatise upon uncertainties. Ideas of
our own concerning the future state can
be but theoretical. The only certainties
are to be found in Divine revelation, and
our theories, if they are worth anything,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_103'>103</span>will harmonise with the Word of God.</p>

<p class='c010'>“However, two great certainties I leave
you to cling to in your loneliness:—Our
eternal Dwelling Place is in the love of
God; and our own perfect love remains to
us eternally. Wherever I may be while
you read this, I am loving you still, with
my whole being; I am all your own, and I
hold you mine for ever.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Now I will lock away this letter with
my will and other papers. Please God, it
may be fifty years before your dear eyes
rest upon it. The fact that I have written
it, lifts from me the dull weight of vague
apprehension.</p>

<p class='c010'>“As I sit writing in the Oak Room, you
lie in our chamber overhead, with our little
one in your arms. Your precious life
has been spared, and a new life has been
given. Heaviness endured for a night, but
joy came in the morning. You have come
safely through this dreaded ordeal. Why
should I apprehend an unknown danger?</p>

<p class='c010'>“So I will put away all apprehension
<span class='pageno' id='Page_104'>104</span>with this letter, and go up to the radiance
of your smile and the glad certainty which
is mine when I clasp you closely in my
arms, my wife, my own!</p>

<p class='c010'>“Your lover and your husband, in Time
and in Eternity,</p>

<div class='c014'>“<span class='sc'>Nigel Tintagel.</span>”</div>

<p class='c011'>He folded the many sheets and returned
them to the envelope.</p>

<p class='c010'>A strange calm had entered into his soul,
a quiet strength which seemed to say:
“Knowing so much, I must know more; I
must know all.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He ceased to feel hunted and haunted.
He had been brought face to face, in these
pages, with a great love; whether his own
or another’s seemed at that moment
scarcely to matter. The very knowledge
of such a love lifted him to a higher plane.
Luke Sparrow had seen deep into the most
sacred recesses of the heart of Nigel Tintagel.
His own empty heart received this
as a trust. A patient strength replaced his
restive horror of resentment at a situation
<span class='pageno' id='Page_105'>105</span>so utterly beyond all human understanding.</p>

<p class='c010'>He laid the letter on the table beside
him, switched off the light, turned his chair
so that he looked into the fire and did not
face the woman on the couch, and said,
very gently: “What happened next?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nigel,” she said: “Do you remember?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I remember nothing,” he answered; but
the harshness was gone from his voice; its
tone was infinitely sad and tender. “I remember
nothing. But I am ready to listen.
I want you to tell me all. I will try to
understand. You need not fear any wild
outbursts now. For the sake of what you
believe—whether it be true or not—I would
give my life to bring you comfort. Tell
me all.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The firelight flickered on the tragic face.
She saw a look of peace it had not held
before. She saw a faint suggestion of the
look of youth which, in its appeal to her
tenderness, had made the man she loved
so adorable.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_106'>106</span>“Oh, Nigel,” she whispered; “Nigel, belovèd!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What happened next?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I read your letter many times. Your
arms seemed to steal around me as I read.
I turned my face against your breast, and
wept myself to calmness. It mattered not
that my head was buried in my pillow. Your
letter had brought you so near; you came
between me and all outward things. I repeated
again and again: ‘Nothing can untwine
my life from thine.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“The warning against spiritualism
reached me just in time. The poor French
‘Madame’ was an ardent spiritualist. She
had secured a medium, and was already in
communication with her daughters. They
had told her their favourite flowers and had
reminded her that they used to prefer
‘<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Chocolat</span></i>’ to ‘<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">café au lait</span></i>,’ for breakfast.
Also that ‘Antoinette’ used to darn their
stockings. Antoinette was an old ‘<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">bonne</span></i>’
who had been with them many years.</p>

<p class='c010'>“These undeniable facts filled ‘Madame’
<span class='pageno' id='Page_107'>107</span>with a holy rapture. She implored me to
come and receive like comfort. I might
have yielded, had it not been for your
timely warning.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Madame’s husband, sons, another
daughter and two cousins, had come to her
in her sorrow. She was quickly growing
resigned—comforted—almost elated. Her
‘deuil’ was infinitely becoming.</p>

<p class='c010'>“But I? I had been robbed of my All.
I dreaded Madame de Villebois’ frequent
visits, yet knew my darling would not wish
me to refuse to see her, lest she should
think I resented the awful part her children
had played in my life’s tragedy. And,
after all, it was madame’s outpourings
which first caused the Great Idea to formulate
in my mind.</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘Ah,’ she cried one day, ‘the brave, the
wonderful Sir Nigel! So full of “<i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">joie de
vivre</span></i>”! So life abounding! No; he cannot
stay <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">parmi les morts</span></i>. Such as he, must live
again.... Quite soon, quite soon, he will
live again. <i><span lang="fr" xml:lang="fr">Il reviendra!</span></i>’</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_108'>108</span>“‘Quite soon? Quite soon?’ I repeated
the words, when my visitor had departed.
<em>Quite soon!</em> Ah, what it would be to know
that my darling was on earth again; breathing
the same air; seeing the same sunshine.
Oh, if he came back <em>quite soon</em>!</p>

<p class='c010'>“I remembered all you had thought and
said on this great subject. You took the
Bible instance of the prophet Elijah reappearing
in John the Baptist—‘<em>More</em> than a
prophet’ because a prophet twice born—as
giving important data from which to draw
conclusions.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Christ Himself had said, in unmistakable
language: ‘If ye will receive it, this is
Elijah which was for to come.... <em>And
they knew him not</em>, but have done unto
him whatsoever they listed.’ These clear
statements, you said, swept away all possibility
of explaining John the Baptist as a
mere type of Elijah. He was, without
doubt, a reincarnation of the great prophet
of fire. Elijah, caught away on the banks
of the river Jordan, his mission incomplete,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_109'>109</span>reappearing on the same spot more than
eight centuries later, to continue his work
of ‘turning the hearts of the disobedient to
the wisdom of the just.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“It would take too long were I to endeavour
to remind you of the perfect working
out of every detail in the wonderful,
inspired story—the comparatively slight
stress laid upon the preparation of the little
earthly body, miraculous though it was;
the thirty years of silence and mystery in
the deserts; then the triumphant heralding
of the full-grown prophet: ‘There was a
man, <em>sent from God</em>, whose name was
John’: his very appearance exactly corresponding
to the Old Testament descriptions
of Elijah.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You held that, though the actual physical
body of a child is prepared by his
parents, according to nature’s laws, his
spirit—his <em>ego</em>—comes direct from God,
entering the body, at the moment of birth,
with the first independent breath the baby
draws. ‘God breathed into his nostrils
<span class='pageno' id='Page_110'>110</span>the breath of life; and man became a living
soul.’ This followed the forming of
the body. ‘Then shall the dust return to
the earth as it was: and the spirit shall return
unto God Who gave it.’ You cannot
<em>return</em> to a place, unless you have been
there before.</p>

<p class='c010'>“From this you argued that, though a
certain amount of likeness to the parents
might be inherited, the <em>ego</em>, being the essential
part, would mould the body into the
appearance it had worn before. A strongly
developed spirit, rich with many former experiences,
would probably stamp its own
likeness so strongly on the bodily development
that very little resemblance to the
immediate parents would obtain. This is
why, in brilliant, gifted children we see so
little family likeness; whereas in families
in which all are as alike as peas in a pod,
you find a lack of gifts, a poverty of mental
development, a want of originality,
which point to no previous experiences.
Having no individual <em>ego</em> of its own, the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_111'>111</span>newly created spirit in its first existence,
allows the body to become an exact copy
of its parents. ‘Adam begat a son in his
own likeness, after his image.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“With all reverence, you regarded the
incarnation of our blessed Lord as throwing
important light upon this point. From
all eternity He had had an outward form.
Man was created in His image. He was
the pattern from which man was fashioned.
In Old Testament records we find that He
appeared many times upon earth and was
seen of men: to Adam, to Abraham, to
Joshua, to Gideon, to Manoah, to Daniel.
These all knew Him, as we say in human
parlance, by sight. The hosts of heaven
knew Him and adored Him in His divinely
glorious outward form. Now comes the
time when He is to lay aside that glory
and be born, very man, of the substance
of an earthly mother. The little body,
stainless and sinless, is prepared of a pure
virgin through the operation of the Holy
Ghost. ‘A body hast Thou prepared for
<span class='pageno' id='Page_112'>112</span>me.’ At the moment of its birth, the great
<em>ego</em> of the Son of God enters into it. Then
‘When He bringeth in the first begotten
into the world, He saith, And let all the
angels of God worship Him’—the scene on
Bethlehem’s hills. By degrees that body
grows, moulded by the <em>ego</em> within, into the
perfect likeness of what a body must ever
be, indwelt by the great <em>Ego</em>—the Son of
God. He is seen by angels, and recognised.
He is seen by demons, and recognised.
He is seen by Moses and Elijah on the
holy mount and, undoubtedly, recognised.
Then—the work of redemption accomplished—raised
from the grave and glorified,
He takes that same body, bearing the
actual scars of crucifixion, back into the
Heavens. Would their King return to
them in wholly different guise?</p>

<p class='c010'>“No; the <em>ego</em>, in its changeless consistency,
has done its perfect work. Whether
‘in the beginning, with God,’ or born of
the Virgin Mary in Bethlehem’s stable, or
ascending triumphant ‘far above all principality,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_113'>113</span>and power, and might, and dominion,
and every name that is named, not
only in this world but also in that which
is to come’—He is, in outward appearance,
as well as in nature and character, Jesus
Christ, the same yesterday, to-day, and
forever.</p>

<p class='c010'>“From these sacred facts you deduced
that any reincarnation of a fully developed
<em>ego</em> would probably reproduce again the
likeness to its previous bodily appearance,
modified to a certain extent by a diversity
of parents, less or more, according to the
strength and richness of the <em>ego</em>.</p>

<p class='c010'>“From this it follows that if one lived
who still held the conscious recollection of
a person in one incarnation, and if a second
incarnation followed so quickly that a meeting
on this earth could take place between
the newly-arrived and the one who remembered,
there would probably be recognition
on the part of the latter.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You also believed that the handwriting,
with certain modifications, would be the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_114'>114</span>same; handwriting being so closely allied
to character, when allowed free development.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You believed that the sub-conscious mind
is an eternal thing, and holds stored within
it every detail of every episode in every
incarnation, be they many or few. But the
conscious mind and memory, being dependent
upon the growth and development of
the actual physical brain, knows and remembers
the happenings of that body’s life,
only. The sub-conscious mind cannot be
drawn upon consciously; but sometimes
there springs up from it, into the conscious
mind, a haunting memory of previous existence:
‘I have been there before! I have
done this before!’</p>

<p class='c010'>“Love being so largely a matter of the
sub-consciousness, lovers are quick to find
and to recognise one another, when they
meet again reincarnate. This accounts for
the sudden instinctive attraction known as
‘love at first sight.’ It is, in reality, two
faithful lovers hailing one another with joy
<span class='pageno' id='Page_115'>115</span>and delight by the unconscious means of
the sub-conscious memory. After marriage
this sub-conscious memory may become an
exquisite certainty, adding a richness to the
bliss of newly-wedded love.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Great gifts can also be handed up to the
new body from the sub-conscious <em>ego</em>. A
born musician is one who, having become a
great musician before by means of long
study and practice, is re-born rich in the
possession of the gift of musical expression.
A born orator has been a practised
speaker in a former life, and now, without
knowing that he does so, draws freely on
his sub-conciousness for inspiration.</p>

<p class='c010'>“<em>Genius</em> is the natural intellect so attuned
to the sub-conscious mind that its fount of
inspiration flows through it unhindered.</p>

<p class='c010'>“<em>Madness</em> is the sub-conscious mind gaining
undue control, bursting the dams of reason
and restraint, and carrying all before
it into mental chaos. A writer who, discovering
that he can do more vividly imaginative
work when his sub-consciousness is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_116'>116</span>in the ascendency, puts himself under the
influence of drugs in order to obtain this
mental condition, may, for a time, produce
work which will astonish the world; but,
before long, there will come the inevitable
fiasco—loss of will power, loss of mental
and moral perspective; nerve and brain
irritation; insanity!</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ah, how crudely and disjointedly I am
repeating all this! It was your favourite
subject, and I might give you essays of
your own to read, with chapter and verse,
and carefully worked out illustration. I
have them all here. I almost know them
by heart. But this hurried outline must
serve to remind us of all you held and
believed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well—to take up the thread of the happenings
of those sad days—first, your letter;
secondly, Madame de Villebois’ remark;
thirdly, my recollection of all you
had taught and told me, awakened in me
the passionate desire that your rebirth into
the world should take place at once.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_117'>117</span>In my awful loss and loneliness it seemed
to me that such unspeakable comfort would
come from the knowledge that my belovèd
was actually on earth again; even if, at
first, he were but a little, helpless babe.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I had always loved the photographs of
my baby Nigel so tenderly—I seemed to
have known and loved you at every age.
At times I saw each age in you and adored
it as I saw it.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And the years would pass, and you
would grow up. After all, when you were
a man of twenty, I should only be forty-eight.
We should certainly have found
each other by then, and my darling would
know me, and would not think me old, for
had he not written: ‘Wherever I may be
I am loving you still, with my whole being.
I am all your own, and I hold you mine for
ever.... We <em>may</em> meet again on earth, if
it be God’s will for us.’ I knew you meant
by this, a fresh incarnation for both; but I
could not see why I must wait during long,
lonely years, or why death must come first.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_118'>118</span>“I began to pray with desperate, frantic
energy that my darling might come back
without delay.</p>

<p class='c010'>“A wild, sweet joy and comfort came to
soothe my agony.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I walked along the shore and prayed
aloud. I roamed the moors in paroxysms
of petition. I prayed all night. I thought
of the many little bodies there must be,
prepared and ready, just waiting for a
splendid, eager spirit to enter them at the
moment of birth. Could not my darling
be sent to one of these and, growing up in
it to his full beauty and stature, come and
find his wife again?</p>

<p class='c010'>“At last, one night, I remembered that
morning when you came in from a swim at
sunrise, when I had been so fearful for
your safety, and how I had said: ‘Oh,
Nigel, my dearest! Some day those treacherous
waters will swallow you up, and you
will come back to me no more.’ But you,
lying in my arms, had made answer: ‘I
shall always come back to you, my sweet.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_119'>119</span>If I lay fifty fathoms deep and <em>you</em> called,
I should hear and come back.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“I remembered this, just before midnight,
on the 11th of September.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I had begun to feel as if all my prayers
and pleadings with heaven had been useless,
had failed to obtain any response.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Now, I would take my husband at his
word, and call him—call him—call him!</p>

<p class='c010'>“I slipped from my bed, opened the
French window and went out on to the
balcony.</p>

<p class='c010'>“There stood the telescope through which
I used to watch you while you swam!</p>

<p class='c010'>“A high wind blew, warm but boisterous.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The sea roared and pounded against the
rocks at the base of the cliff.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I stood in the wind-swept darkness and
lifted my eyes to the distant stars.</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘Nigel!’ I called aloud: ‘Oh, Nigel, my
lover, my husband, come back to earth!
Come out of Eternity, back into Time. I
cannot <em>live</em> on this earth without you. You
promised—you <em>promised</em> to come from fifty
<span class='pageno' id='Page_120'>120</span>fathoms deep, if I called. NIGEL! COME!
Ask to be born once more. Then grow up
quickly, and seek, and seek, and seek, belovèd,
until you find me. Nigel, your own
wife calls! Oh, Nigel! COME!’</p>

<p class='c010'>“Long I stood, with clasped hands, gazing
upward to the stars.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The wind moaned and shrieked through
the pines. The sea roared in the distance.
Behind the house, an owl hooted, like a lost
soul in agony, and seemed to mock my
prayer.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Up on the hill, the church bell tolled
thrice.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Suddenly an intense drowsiness overcame
me—I, who for a month past had
scarcely slept. I crept back to bed and fell
asleep as my head touched the pillow.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I slept until ten o’clock the next morning,
then woke with such a sense of comfort
and joy, that I could not understand
what had happened.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then I remembered my call to you at
midnight. And then I knew—knew with
<span class='pageno' id='Page_121'>121</span>an unhesitating certainty—that my belovèd
had kept his word; that some time between
midnight and ten o’clock, on this 12th of
September, 1883, he had come back, for my
sake, and was now on earth once more,
spending his first day as a little living,
growing, beautiful man-child.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, the wonder of those hours! My
breasts thrilled and ached with joy and
longing. Ah, if I could but press his baby
lips against them! The wife in me was
merged in the wish that I could be his
mother! I lived again. I smiled and
laughed. For a long, weary month I had
trailed about. I now ran up and down
stairs. I lifted my arms to the sun and
blessed him, as he rose in the heavens,
because he was shining on my little boy.
I tried to picture his nursery, his bassinet,
his little gowns and flannels.</p>

<p class='c010'>“My household evidently thought me demented;
but I knew that this joy had saved
my reason.</p>

<p class='c010'>“During the next few days I scanned
<span class='pageno' id='Page_122'>122</span>with eager eyes the births’ column in the
‘Times,’ making a list of the names and addresses
of all the parents who had had sons
on the 12th of September.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, Nigel, Nigel! I little thought—a
door-step! A deserted bundle! A Foundlings’
Institution! Oh, my dear, if I could
have flown to that door-step and found you,
and brought you home! But—did you not
say there was a date on the label, the date
of your birth, written beneath ‘Returned
Empty’?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes,” he said. “You shall see the label.
There is a date.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He drew his chair near to the couch, so
that he could reach her hands with his own.
He took the label from his pocket-book,
and laid it upon her lap. She lifted it and,
bending toward him, read it by the firelight.</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>RETURNED EMPTY</div>
    <div class='c003'><em>September 12th, 1883.</em></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_123'>123</span>“Oh, Nigel,” she said, “the day—the
very day!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I know,” he answered. “I was listening
for it as you talked. I felt it would
come.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And it is to-day,” she said. “To-day!
This is your thirtieth birthday.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He looked at her with a wistful smile; a
smile of such pathetic melancholy that it
chilled her heart.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is,” he said. “And nobody in the
whole world knows it, save you and I.”</p>

<p class='c010'>She stretched out her hands.</p>

<p class='c010'>He took them in his and held them
firmly. They looked into each other’s eyes
in silence.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Speak to me,” she whispered.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not yet,” he said. “You have more to
tell. And it has always been my way to
think long and steadily, and then to speak—and
to speak to the point. You and I
are facing an awful mystery; but at least
we are facing it together.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_124'>124</span>Suddenly she felt herself before a judgment-seat.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, Nigel,” she whispered, “I am
afraid.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You need not be,” he answered and,
bending, laid his lips upon her hand. “I
have read Nigel Tintagel’s letter.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“And do you remember?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I remember nothing. But my soul is
slowly struggling up into the light. After
long years in outer darkness, at last I am
finding the way home to God.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Again he laid his lips upon her hands;
but they were cold as death, and her heart
trembled.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Tell me the rest,” he said.</p>

<p class='c010'>She steadied her voice with an effort.</p>

<p class='c010'>“There is not much to tell. It has been
a long, long time of seeking and waiting.
I kept count of each year. I made little
clothes of the right size, and gave them
away. In the summers I went from one
seaside place to another and roamed about
the shore, seeking among the little boys who
<span class='pageno' id='Page_125'>125</span>shouted and played, rode donkeys, wielded
their wooden spades, and made sand castles.
I neglected my little daughter because
I wanted only the boy who was
doubly my own. Then I remembered she
was yours, and flew back to make amends.</p>

<p class='c010'>“When the right time came, I went to
the public schools, Eton, Harrow, Marlborough,
Rugby. I watched the sports; I
saw the prize-givings. Crowds of fine British
lads were there; but the face I sought
was not among them.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Later, I went to Oxford and Cambridge.
I saw degrees conferred; I viewed the
races. I went to Lord’s; you had been
keen on cricket. But you were not there.</p>

<p class='c010'>“At last I knew your education must be
over. You must have taken your place in
the world—a man among men. Then I
gave up my search, and waited here—just
waited. Your room was always ready. I
felt certain you would come to me at last.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Eight years ago our daughter married.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_126'>126</span>Then I was left alone, and I was glad. Little
Nigel was born, and he was <em>so</em> like you.
But that was no comfort to me; it was you
I wanted, not a likeness. I never doubted
that you would find me at last.</p>

<p class='c010'>“And to-night—to-night, after thirty
years—I looked up and saw my husband’s
eyes gazing in at me through the window.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The very greatness of the moment kept
me calm. I had just to make sure you
would not go. I could not tell Colin and
Eva; they would have thought me mad.
But old Thomas knew. He recognised you
at once.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Recognised me?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, Nigel. He had known and loved
and served you from boyhood. He ran beside
your pony the first time you rode
alone. He and his wife are the only people
left among the household who remember
you. When I sent him to fetch you in,
I told him you had come at last, and
warned him to give no sign of recognition
until I had found out how much you knew.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_127'>127</span>He has shared with me the long years of
vigil.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Luke Sparrow buried his face in his
hands.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Good God,” he muttered; “let me keep
my reason.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Midnight sounded slowly from a distant
belfry.</p>

<p class='c010'>The old clock in the corner whirred its
warning, and struck the hour.</p>

<p class='c010'>Lady Tintagel took up her jewel-case.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Come and sit here beside me, and see
why Thomas could not fail to know you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He rose. His knees shook. He felt
queer and dizzy. It had been a long time
of mental strain.</p>

<p class='c010'>Lady Tintagel turned on a light behind
her, and moved the despatch-box.</p>

<p class='c010'>He took his seat beside her on the couch.</p>

<p class='c010'>A packet of faded photographs were in
her hand.</p>

<p class='c010'>“This is the first. Your mother gave it
to me; my baby Nigel; six months old. She
used to call you her little Black Prince,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_128'>128</span>because of your dark eyes and regal bearing.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He took the faded picture and bent
over it.</p>

<p class='c010'>The bright eyes of the baby had survived
the yellowing process of sixty years. They
held a look of baby omniscience as they
stared into the haunted eyes of the man
who bent and looked. The little figure sat
erect, one finger lifted as if solemnly pointing
a moral. The mother, on whose lap the
baby sat, was so much absorbed in watching
its expression, that her back was
turned. He could see only a gracious figure
and smoothly braided hair.</p>

<p class='c011'>“Aged three,” said Lady Tintagel, passing
another.</p>

<p class='c010'>The same bright eyes, now merry with
childish laughter, and half hidden in a mass
of tumbled curls. Bare legs, white socks,
strap shoes, a wooden horse. The marvel
was that he stayed still ten seconds to
be photographed. He must have whooped
and run, the moment it was over.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_129'>129</span>“Aged seven,” said Lady Tintagel. “I
love him in his kilt.”</p>

<p class='c010'>A graceful little figure in full Highland
dress; standing, as if just arrested in a
dance, one hand above his head; his dark
eyes shining, his curls escaping from the
Glengarry bonnet.</p>

<p class='c010'>The man’s hand shook, as he laid it
down.</p>

<p class='c010'>“No more just now,” he said, thickly.
“I don’t—see very clearly.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Just the last,” she insisted, “the last of
all; that you may understand how it was
that Thomas knew you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>She drew out a cabinet portrait and
placed it in his hands. Beneath it was written:
“<em>Nigel, one week before I lost him.
August, 1883.</em>”</p>

<p class='c010'>A man in flannels, carrying a pair of
sculls over his shoulder; smiling that he
should be caught by a photographer on his
way to the boats; his whole face and figure
radiating health and happiness; a look of
well-being, of honest, genial love to all
<span class='pageno' id='Page_130'>130</span>mankind; of innate goodness, purity,
strength—a man made for love and for
companionship; a man to whom a woman
would trust herself, body and soul, and
never regret it.</p>

<p class='c010'>No contrast could have been more
marked than that between the man portrayed
and the man who now looked at
the portrait; but the contrast was one of
heart, mind, and character, not of outward
semblance. For, as he looked, seeing only
the portrait, in a room growing suddenly
black, he knew he looked upon himself—himself,
as he might have been; himself,
as he once was.</p>

<p class='c010'>Lady Tintagel returned the others to
their place of safety. She fitted them all
in with loving care; then turned to take
the last.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Can you wonder——” she began; then
paused dismayed.</p>

<p class='c010'>The man beside her tried to rise, groped
blindly for support, then swayed slowly
forward, and fell senseless at her feet.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_133'>133</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>SCENE VIII<br /> <span class='large'>THE DAWN BREAKS</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>When consciousness returned, he
found himself stretched at full
length upon the couch.</p>

<p class='c010'>Lady Tintagel knelt beside him, her arms
around him.</p>

<p class='c010'>He could feel the rapid beating of her
heart; her soft, quick breathing, mingled
with kisses, on his brow and hair. Words
of tenderness unthinkable poured from her
lips.</p>

<p class='c010'>He woke at once to vivid consciousness;
but lay with eyes closed, waiting till he
could gather up his strength, master himself,
and take hold on calm speech.</p>

<p class='c010'>And all the while her flood of tenderness
poured over him. It was as if his helplessness
had broken down all barriers,
his loss of consciousness had burst the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_134'>134</span>bonds of her reserve. The love and longing
of those thirty years throbbed in her
clasping arms.</p>

<p class='c010'>“My Love, my own! Don’t go from me
again. Ah, when you wake you will remember
all! Nigel, you will remember.”</p>

<p class='c010'>She held him closer to her breast. He felt
the desperate strength in those poor clinging
arms.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Dear God, when he awakes, he will
remember! He will call his own wife by
her name. He will know all at last. At
last he will remember.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Her tears and kisses rained upon his
face.</p>

<p class='c010'>At length he spoke.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Loose me,” he said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mine,” she murmured, her trembling
lips against his hair. “Mine again, at last.
I have waited so long—so long.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He shrank away from her.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Loose me,” he said, “loose me and let
me go. I do not want to hurt you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You could not hurt me, Nigel. I am
<span class='pageno' id='Page_135'>135</span>past being hurt. My love would welcome
pain.” Yet her lips quivered. Her eyes
searched his. No answering light of love
was in their sombre depths.</p>

<p class='c010'>“You would loose me at once,” he said,
“if you could know how much I loathe that
you should hold and touch me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Her arms fell away from him. She
pressed her hands against her breasts, as
if his words had been an actual blow. She
recoiled from him, moving backwards on
her knees, gazing at him in dumb dismay;
then hid her stricken face in both her
hands.</p>

<p class='c010'>He sprang to his feet, crossed to the window,
and flung aside a curtain.</p>

<p class='c010'>Dawn was breaking, in one pale silver
streak on the horizon.</p>

<p class='c010'>Sea birds called to one another in the
distance.</p>

<p class='c010'>A chill mist lay on the lawn. In the corner
of the veranda he could see the ghostly
outline of the chair in which he had waited
the night before.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_136'>136</span>He turned back into the lighted room.</p>

<p class='c010'>The fire burned low. He stirred the embers
and threw on fresh logs.</p>

<p class='c010'>He raised Lady Tintagel from her knees
and led her to the couch.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Forgive me,” he said. “How I hate to
give you pain! But our only hope is to be
absolutely honest with ourselves and with
each other.”</p>

<p class='c010'>She lifted sorrowful eyes, but made no
answer.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Will you forgive me if that which I
must say is hard to hear? It would help
me if you could say: ‘I will forgive you’”</p>

<p class='c010'>Her smile was sadder far than tears.</p>

<p class='c010'>“We never forgave one another, Nigel.
If need for forgiveness arose, love had already
met it, and swept it away. Besides,
I do not blame you for my pain. Say what
you will.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He stood long silent, looking into the
heart of the red embers.</p>

<p class='c010'>At last he spoke.</p>

<p class='c010'>“It is dangerous work,” he said, “to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_137'>137</span>tamper with the Dead. The Dead are safe
with God, at home in that eternal Dwelling
Place. Do you realise the awful wrong you
did to me and to yourself, by that insistent
call which brought me back? Through
all these years in the great Life beyond,
the fulness of my love would have been
yours. That letter told you of a changeless
tie—you mine, I yours, for ever. But it
also spoke of a parting bravely borne, in
faith and patience. A sorrow thus endured
would have kept us both safe in the Will of
God. But you called me back, with passionate
insistence, and—it seems—I responded
to the passion of that appeal, and
came. But in so doing, I put myself outside
the supreme Will. Had I waited God’s
time for my return to earthly life, I might
have come strong in His strength and
grace, filled with his Holy Spirit, ready to
overcome, to rise at His command to a
higher level than I had before attained.
Instead of which I am but a poor derelict,
shipwrecked upon life’s ocean, drifting rudderless
<span class='pageno' id='Page_138'>138</span>at the mercy of each wind of circumstance.
And alas, I returned empty—emptied
of that Spark Divine, which is the
very essence of the life of man; emptied
of aspiration; emptied of the capacity for
love. I have no assurance of the Love of
God; I have no remembrance of my love
for you; I have no power to feel love for
others or to accept love offered me. For
thirty wasted years I have been seeking,
seeking, ever seeking, for earthly love, and
now that I have found it, it is Dead Sea
fruit—mere dust and ashes. I wander,
God forsaken, like the demons of old,
‘walking through dry places, seeking rest,
and finding none.’ I have no faith, I have
no hope; I ask only for Oblivion. ‘Why
hast thou disquieted me, to bring me up?’
You who call yourself my loving wife?</p>

<p class='c010'>“One sentence in that letter which you
say is my own, wakes in me a realisation of
all that I have lost. ‘Lord, Thou hast been
our Dwelling Place in all generations.’
My soul remembers that divine security;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_139'>139</span>but I have left it, and there is no return.
You thought, while I lay senseless I should
remember things of Time. Not so, but in
a lightning flash of revelation I saw again
Eternity.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Turning, he raised both arms, lifting his
face with a light upon it which was not the
dawn, nor any earthly light, but a pale reflection
of the light of Heaven.</p>

<p class='c010'>“God’s Will!” he said. “When we go
home to that great Dwelling Place, our
holy passion is to do His Will. All earthly
things—loves, hopes, desires—assume their
right proportions. The one Essential is the
great Will of God—that He in us, by us,
through us, may in all things be glorified.
All, in our earthly lives, which made for
this, abides, and is ours still. All else is
dross and cannot stand the fire—that purity
of motive which is the very birthright of
each immortal soul set free from earthly
trammels of the flesh. To know His will
and do it—this is Life Eternal; this is the
joy supreme.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_140'>140</span>His arms dropped. The light faded from
his countenance.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I left it, at the call of earthly love. I
stand before you empty, godless, damned.”</p>

<p class='c011'>“Nigel,” she said; “my heart is broken.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I would I had a heart to break,” he
said.</p>

<p class='c010'>The despair in her face left him cold.
Yet still her faithful love caught at a straw
of comfort.</p>

<p class='c010'>“At least we are together in our misery.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am going,” he said.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nigel! You will not leave me?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“How can I stay? A year younger than
your own daughter, I cannot stand in my
rightful place—nor would I, if I could.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nigel, stay as my son.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“How can I? I am not your son, and I
will not be a rich woman’s protégé. I may
have no capacity for love, but I have honour.
I shall go, as I came, empty and
alone. I will take nothing with me from
<span class='pageno' id='Page_141'>141</span>this great house which you tell me is, in
reality, my own.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nigel, there is one thing you <em>must</em> take
with you. It was your tenderest gift to
me. It has been so precious all these years;
but now I have forfeited the right to wear
it.”</p>

<p class='c010'>She drew her wedding-ring from her finger.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I have failed you, utterly.”</p>

<p class='c010'>She held it out to him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“The golden circlet, emblem of a love
which is eternal, would mock me in my
hopeless desolation. Take it, Nigel. It is
all you can do for me. When you placed
it on my finger, you had just said: ‘Till
death us do part’; and death has parted
us.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not death,” he said. “Life has parted
us, not death.”</p>

<p class='c010'>A heavy sense of sorrow and compunction
gripped him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Why do you ask me to do this? It
leaves you neither wife nor widow.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_142'>142</span>“I <em>am</em> neither wife nor widow. I am not
your widow, for you live. I am not your
wife, for you loathe me, and are leaving
me forever.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I do not loathe you,” he said, in low,
remorseful tones. “But you have shewn
me what I was; and you have made me
what I am.”</p>

<p class='c010'>A spasm of deathly agony wrung her
heart. Could he not spare her one cruel
stab?</p>

<p class='c010'>She pressed the ring upon him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Take it, I implore you. And if ever
the remembrance returns of all that this
ring once meant to us, come back to me,
and place it again upon my hand.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He took it. For what had it stood when
last he held it in his hand? The complete
possession of a perfect love?</p>

<p class='c010'>He slipped it on to his little finger.</p>

<p class='c010'>His gnawing misery grew. Why could
he not say one word of kindness or of comfort
to this stricken woman whose faithful
heart was breaking?</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_143'>143</span>His hell was within him, “where the
worm dieth not, and the fire is not
quenched.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He rose abruptly. “I must go!” he
said.</p>

<p class='c010'>He crossed to the garden door and flung
it wide.</p>

<p class='c010'>A stream of golden sunshine poured in,
paling the artificial light, and flooding the
room with radiance.</p>

<p class='c010'>The sun had risen, a great golden ball,
above the sea, and was slowly ascending
from the pearly mist on the horizon.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I must go,” he said, again; but a
dreamy quality had come into his voice,
and he leaned against the door post, gazing
at the sunrise.</p>

<p class='c010'>She came and stood beside him, and together
they looked up to the rosy sky,
flecked with soft billowy clouds of pearly
whiteness, and down on the wide expanse
of opal sea, reflecting in a royal highway
from shore to horizon, the crimson glory
of the rising sun.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_144'>144</span>The water seemed to shout, once more,
in a silent chorus of sparkling voices:
“This is the way to the City of Gold!
Leap from the cliff! Take to the waters!
This—and this only—is your road for
Home.”</p>

<p class='c011'>Suddenly a look of hope shone in his
eyes. His whole figure sprang to alertness.
He was transformed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I must go!” he cried. “There lies the
way.” He pointed to the sparkling path
upon the waters. “It is my only chance;
my one way Home.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not that, Nigel! Oh, not that!” Her
clinging hands caught at his coat. “You
always said those who did that would
lose—”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Lose!” he shouted. “What have I to
lose? Returned empty! I have nothing
to lose.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He wrenched himself free from her detaining
fingers. He gave no backward
<span class='pageno' id='Page_145'>145</span>glance. He sped across the lawn, like a
hound loosed from the leash; leapt the iron
gate, and disappeared down the zigzag path
leading to the beach.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>SCENE IX<br /> <span class='large'>THE WATCHER</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>Lady Tintagel turned back into
the Oak Room, switched off the pale
lights, gathered up her treasures,
locked the despatch-box and, taking it with
her, crossed the hall and slowly mounted
the stairs to her bedroom. Each step meant
a separate effort. The mainspring of her
life was broken. This was the end.</p>

<p class='c010'>Arrived at her room, she slipped off her
velvet gown, put on a soft white wrapper,
and laid herself down upon the bed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘They went away toward the sunrising,’”
she quoted. “Where is it written?”
She repeated it, mechanically. “‘They went
away toward the sunrising.’”</p>

<p class='c010'>Then memory returned and with it the
shock of realisation.</p>

<p class='c010'>He had gone. He had gone for ever.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_150'>150</span>He was swimming into the sunrise, and
never coming back.</p>

<p class='c010'>Dear God—was there no hope, no help?</p>

<p class='c010'>She rose from the bed.</p>

<p class='c010'>She must watch to the end.</p>

<p class='c010'>She went out on to the wide balcony,
overlooking the sea, where stood the telescope.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>SCENE X<br /> <span class='large'>“WHEN THAT WHICH DREW FROM OUT THE BOUNDLESS DEEP—TURNS AGAIN HOME”</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>When Luke Sparrow reached the
beach, he tore at his boot-laces,
flung off his coat and, in less
than twenty seconds, was swimming up
the sunlit way, his eyes dazzled by the
golden glory, his heart throbbing from his
rapid race down the cliff.</p>

<p class='c010'>He seemed to have burst invisible
shackles which hitherto had held him captive.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Free!” he shouted. “Free! On to the
sunrise! No going back!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Wild sea birds, flying above him, swooped
and dipped, till their wings almost touched
his face as they passed.</p>

<p class='c010'>He laughed, and echoed their wild cries.</p>

<p class='c010'>“God give me wings, that I may mount
and rise!”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_154'>154</span>He dived into green depths where fishes
flopped against his face, and waving arms
of giant sea-weed tried to catch him as he
passed.</p>

<p class='c010'>He came to the surface gasping; dashed
the water from his eyes; then settled into a
steady breast stroke, swimming out to sea,
straight to the sun.</p>

<p class='c010'>He swam. He swam. He swam. On,
toward the shoreless horizon.</p>

<p class='c010'>His heart pounded in his ears. Still he
swam on.</p>

<p class='c010'>His arms felt like lead. He folded them
across his breast and swam without them.</p>

<p class='c010'>His legs could move no more. He turned
upon his back and lay, like a bit of driftwood,
resting.</p>

<p class='c010'>He grinned at the blue sky above him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Flotsam and jetson,” he remarked confidentially
to a swooping gull. “‘Returned
Empty. This side up, with care.’ That’s
more to the point just now. Don’t peck at
my eyes, you greedy brute! Wait a week
for that.... Here lies a poor derelict on
<span class='pageno' id='Page_155'>155</span>the ocean of Time, at the mercy of every
wind of circumstance.... Swim, you fool!
Yonder lies your one way Home.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He turned over, and swam on and on,
into the dazzling glory.</p>

<p class='c010'>At length a dream-like sense of unreality
came over him, a strange, sweet peace;
a wish to fall asleep.</p>

<p class='c010'>He heard church bells in the distance,
growing nearer.</p>

<p class='c010'>At first he thought they came floating out
to sea from the land he had left behind, and
he ceased swimming that he might listen.</p>

<p class='c010'>Then they pealed louder, coming up—up—from
the green depths beneath him.</p>

<p class='c010'>He looked down and instantly sank—deep,
deep, deep into the cool silence. Instinctively
he held his breath, threw up his
hands and rose to the surface; gasped, took
a long breath; raised his arms above his
head and went down like a stone.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_156'>156</span>Deeper, deeper, deeper.</p>

<p class='c010'>The church bells pealed so loudly, he
thought their clanging clamour would burst
the drums of his ears.</p>

<p class='c010'>He was entangled in flapping sea-weed,
but he fought himself free. It was very
dark.</p>

<p class='c010'>He threw up his arms and rose slowly to
the surface.</p>

<p class='c010'>The sun seemed miles above him, a pale
phantom, luminous through the green
waters.</p>

<p class='c010'>It grew brighter. He reached the surface.
It blazed upon him.</p>

<p class='c010'>The church bells stopped suddenly.
Everything stopped. His heart stopped.
There was a great silence.</p>

<p class='c010'>He was too tired to breathe. He clasped
<span class='pageno' id='Page_157'>157</span>his hands, lifted them slowly above his
head, and went down for the third time.</p>

<p class='c010'>As he sank he heard the head-master
say: “Luke Sparrow—first prize”; he saw
the glitter of the Mayor’s grand chain. All
his school life rushed backward through his
mind, and then—he was flinging down a
rattle on the nursery floor, and the matron’s
voice was saying: “Poor little ‘Returned
Empty.’ He won’t even play with his rattle.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’m really drowning now,” he thought.
“The fools are right. This is my past life.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“<em>What does he want?</em>” said the matron’s
voice. “<em>Who is he calling?</em>”</p>

<p class='c010'>Then—something burst in his brain, and
in flaming letters of living fire a name illumined
the icy blackness.</p>

<p class='c010'>“<span class='sc'>Miriam!</span> My wife! Miriam, my Love,
my life! Good God, I can’t leave her!...
Miriam, I’m coming! Hold on, I am coming!”</p>

<p class='c010'>The weeds had him this time, but he
fought like a madman.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_158'>158</span>“Miriam! Belovèd!”</p>

<p class='c010'>His lungs were bursting, but he kept
out the water. Tons weight pressed down
his hands, but he lifted them.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Miriam, my Love! I am coming!”</p>

<p class='c010'>The sun reappeared, a pale disc—no, by
God! a dead face!</p>

<p class='c010'>He was caught again. Sea-weed? No;
white hands, catching at his throat, throttling
him. Curse them! What matter they,
while his wife waits. He fought on.</p>

<p class='c010'>“My Love, I am coming!” He broke
free and rose—rose—rose.</p>

<p class='c010'>The sun—Great God!—the air!</p>

<p class='c010'>He breathed, choked, gasped, breathed
again; lay on the surface, and panted. His
ribs seemed jammed upon his heart; but,
as he breathed, they lifted. His lungs expanded;
his sight cleared; his heart beat
more steadily.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, belovèd! Miriam! Miriam! Are
you there? All else is a dream, save our
great love, my perfect, perfect mate.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_159'>159</span>Slowly he turned and looked toward the
shore.</p>

<p class='c010'>Far away, so far away; but he could see
the line of cliffs and the house—his home
and hers—standing clear against the fir
woods. The upper windows seemed on fire,
as they reflected the gold of the sunrise.</p>

<p class='c010'>He measured the distance between himself
and the shore. Could he swim it?</p>

<p class='c010'>He started a slow breast stroke, his eyes
upon those flaming windows.</p>

<p class='c010'>Then he remembered the telescope. He
made out the balcony.</p>

<p class='c010'>Dear God! Was she watching? Of
course she was watching.</p>

<p class='c010'>He fancied he could see a white figure.</p>

<p class='c010'>He waved his arm and smiled. A glory
of love was on his face.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Miriam,” he said, knowing the powerful
lens brought him quite near and she
would see him speak; “Miriam, you said
I should remember all, if I remembered
your name. And I do; oh, my belovèd, I
do!”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_160'>160</span>As he swam, the sunlight caught the
wedding-ring—her wedding-ring-upon his
finger. He missed a stroke to hold it up,
then press it to his lips.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I am coming, Sweet! I am coming!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Then he swam on.</p>

<p class='c010'>Love, surging through his soul, gave him
strength.</p>

<p class='c010'>The shore drew nearer. He could see
her now, standing at the telescope.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Miriam! Miriam!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Her dear arms would be waiting. Her
lips—her tenderness.</p>

<p class='c010'>Could he last out? He swam feebly,
but steadily.</p>

<p class='c010'>As he neared the shore, a swiftly flowing
current caught him. It held him stationary,
and his strength was ebbing.</p>

<p class='c010'>One chance remained. He might win
through under water. He took a deep
breath, dived, and disappeared.</p>

<p class='c010'>Swift, quick strokes—“Miriam! Miriam!”
Desperate work; but for her dear sake!</p>

<p class='c010'>He rose at last. He was through the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_161'>161</span>current and under the lee of the cliff.
He could see the house no longer, but the
zigzag path was there. His coat and his
boots lay under the rocks.</p>

<p class='c010'>He fought feebly with the water. His
breath came in groans.</p>

<p class='c010'>No; he could not do it, after all. Not
another stroke. He must sink; he must
give up, and sink.</p>

<p class='c010'>He sank—and felt sand beneath his feet.</p>

<p class='c010'>With a great cry he struggled through
the water, reeled up the beach, and dropped
like a log beside the rocks.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>SCENE XI<br /> <span class='large'>“MY LIFE FOR HIS!”</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>When Lady Tintagel stepped out
on to the balcony and took her
stand beside the telescope, a
deathly sense of faintness almost overcame
her. She gripped the balustrade to keep
herself from falling.</p>

<p class='c010'>Gradually she revived in the fresh morning
air.</p>

<p class='c010'>Then she adjusted the telescope and
focussed it on the dark head in the water.</p>

<p class='c010'>The powerful lens brought the swimmer
so near, that it seemed as if she had but
to put out her hand to touch him.</p>

<p class='c010'>He was swimming in direct line between
herself and the rising sun. The water
through which he moved, sparkled and glittered.
She could see every strand of his
<span class='pageno' id='Page_166'>166</span>wet hair, her wedding-ring on his brown
finger.</p>

<p class='c010'>She marked the strong, quick strokes.
Rapidly he put distance between himself
and the shore. She had to keep adjusting
the focus to hold him near.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh God,” she prayed, “do not let him do
this thing. Do not let him drown. If a life
must be given, my life for his. Oh, by the
mercy of Christ, my life for his!”</p>

<p class='c010'>She saw the wild birds swoop above him.</p>

<p class='c010'>After a while he began to flag. She
watched him fold his arms, turn upon his
back, and lie, like a tired child, upon the
bosom of the sparkling ocean.</p>

<p class='c010'>Then she could see his face, ghastly in
the sunlight. There was madness in it—madness.</p>

<p class='c010'>“O God of infinite mercy! My punishment
is greater than I can bear. I bow
to Thy Divine Will. I give up my belovèd;
I give him up, if need be, for all eternity;
but save him from the doom of the suicide.
My life for his, O Lord, my life for his!”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_167'>167</span>He had turned, and was swimming on;
but his movements were vague and uncertain.
He clove the water feebly, pausing
between each stroke and raising his head.</p>

<p class='c010'>Suddenly he disappeared. The sparkling
highway held no sign of him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nigel!” she shrieked, “Nigel!”</p>

<p class='c010'>The brown hands reappeared; the dark
head rose out of the sea. But making no
attempt to swim, he lifted his face to the
sun, then raised his arms and went down
again.</p>

<p class='c010'>“O God, have mercy!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Oh, mocking, vast expanse of gaily
sparkling sea!</p>

<p class='c010'>She held her breath and watched.</p>

<p class='c010'>Ah! His hands again! His face—the
eyes now wide and staring. He gasped; his
chest heaved. He raised his head and
shoulders out of the water; then slowly
clasped his hands, lifted them above his
head, and sank instantly.</p>

<p class='c010'>She was silent in her agony; yet, speechless,
her heart still cried to God.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_168'>168</span>“Save him! Save him! My soul for
his! O God, my soul for his!”</p>

<p class='c010'>O empty, sunlit sea!</p>

<p class='c010'>The floor rocked and swayed beneath her
feet. She clung to the telescope, striving
to keep in view the rippling surface where
last she had seen him.</p>

<p class='c010'>No sign, no hope. This was the end.</p>

<p class='c010'>An awful calmness held her. “Fifty
fathoms deep,” and this time no return.
She and Despair must company together
through all the years to come, and after.</p>

<p class='c010'>No! O God, his hands! And now his
head, his heaving, gasping chest!</p>

<p class='c010'>He fought and struck the water, then
straightened out and lay upon his back,
heaving, breathing; breathing, heaving;
gasping with closed eyes; then quite still,
resting; a weary child upon its mother’s
breast; a lover in the tender arms of his
belovèd. The water rocked him gently. So
near he seemed. She clung to the telescope,
speaking softly to him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nigel, my dearest, God has heard my
<span class='pageno' id='Page_169'>169</span>prayer. Rest there, dear Heart. The arms
of Eternal Love are beneath you. Oh, if
the wish to live returns, you will be given
strength to reach the shore. Heart of my
heart, my life for yours; my <em>soul</em> for yours,
if need be.”</p>

<p class='c010'>His eyes were open. He was gazing
skyward. A look of ineffable joy and peace
was on his face.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, what does he see? Visions of God?
Promise of life and peace and joy restored?
Or is he dying; dying there, before my
eyes? Nigel, my own, what is it?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Slowly he turned and looked toward the
shore; then started swimming, a steady
breast stroke, slow but sure.</p>

<p class='c010'>Her trembling fingers adjusted the focus,
keeping pace with him.</p>

<p class='c010'>His eyes met hers. A glory of love was
on his face. He waved his arm and smiled.
His lips moved and formed a word.</p>

<p class='c010'>Yes, it was her name!</p>

<p class='c010'>“Miriam,” he said; and again, “Miriam!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, wonder beyond belief. He has remembered
<span class='pageno' id='Page_170'>170</span>and is coming back to me; coming
back a second time from the dead; but
this time God-sent, God-given.”</p>

<p class='c010'>She laughed softly and whispered tender
words.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, darling, I know. Yes, your wife
is here; just waiting here, as on those dear
mornings long ago.... Swim carefully,
my dearest boy. I do so dread the sea—so
deep and treacherous.... Yes, I see
the ring.... Oh, is that how you love
me? No, don’t stop to answer ... Nigel,
it takes so long.... Are you exhausted,
darling? Oh, turn again and rest....
Nigel, you make no progress. Oh, my God,
he is swimming, but he is not moving! He
is caught by the current!... Ah!...
No!... Yes! He is gone!”</p>

<p class='c010'>She flew into her room and pealed the
bell. Then back to the balcony, shrieking
wildly. So near the shore, but gone.</p>

<p class='c010'>An empty sea; a cruel, sparkling, empty
sea!</p>

<p class='c010'>The sound of hurrying feet within. She
<span class='pageno' id='Page_171'>171</span>staggered back into the room, clutching at
the window-frame and curtains.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Quick, Thomas, quick! Sir Nigel—drowning—below
the cliff—a boat—a
rope—”</p>

<p class='c010'>Then she fell forward on her face.</p>

<div class='chapter'>
  <span class='pageno' id='Page_175'>175</span>
  <h2 class='c005'>SCENE XII<br /> <span class='large'>THE DEEP WELL</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>When Luke Sparrow awoke from
a long sleep, he found himself
in bed, wrapped in softest
blankets, in the room to which he had been
taken on the previous evening.</p>

<p class='c010'>His entire being was permeated by that
extraordinary sense of comfort which accompanies
returning strength after violent
exertion. He had no desire to move, yet he
lifted his right arm and looked with a perplexed
smile at the sleeve of a blue silk
sleeping suit. Then he saw the wedding-ring
upon his finger.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Miriam!”</p>

<p class='c010'>He let a flood of tender memory sweep
over him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Miriam! My wife.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Presently he looked round the room, taking
<span class='pageno' id='Page_176'>176</span>in every detail. It was familiar in a
strange, double way. His conscious brain
remembered each impression of the night
before, when he thought it “Colin’s” dressing-room;
but a vague, dream-like memory,
working slowly, like drawing water from
the depths of a deep well, remembered
it as his own.</p>

<p class='c010'>He studied the engravings on the walls,
seeing them consciously for the first time;
but when he looked away, it seemed to him
that he had known, before looking, that
each would be in its place.</p>

<p class='c010'>He looked along the row of books in the
bookcase. His conscious mind mastered
their titles; but, from the deep well of his
sub-consciousness he drew the knowledge
of what, if he could open them, he would
find written on the fly-leaves.</p>

<p class='c010'>This experiment soon tired him. He
lifted his hand again and fixed his mind
upon the wedding-ring, and upon her whose
ring it was.</p>

<p class='c010'>Nothing vague here, nothing indefinite.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_177'>177</span>His love for her, his memory of her love,
flowed through him like new wine. Her
loveliness, her tenderness, her sweet fidelity.</p>

<p class='c010'>He held the ring against his lips. “My
bride”—what memories! “My wife, my
perfect mate!”</p>

<p class='c010'>To him, who had never loved, it came as
an overwhelming wonder to find himself
in sudden possession of a love full grown.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Miriam! Miriam!”</p>

<p class='c010'>Soon he would see her. She was somewhere
quite near.</p>

<p class='c010'>Oh, heart of gold, beating beneath the
garment of soft woman’s flesh!</p>

<p class='c010'>He closed his eyes and gave himself up
to the exquisite enchantment. The purity
of each remembrance of her love and his,
filled him with a sense of heavenly rapture.</p>

<p class='c010'>“My perfect one; my Angel of Delight!”</p>

<p class='c010'>The door opened softly. An elderly
woman appeared, stout and matronly, carrying
<span class='pageno' id='Page_178'>178</span>a cup on a small tray. She advanced
to the side of the bed.</p>

<p class='c010'>He had never seen her before. He
studied the kind, homely face, the neat
black gown, the silk apron, the cairngorm
brooch. Then from the depths of the well
came up an intuition and, almost before he
knew it, he had said: “Hullo, Mary.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The ruddy face paled. The hand holding
the tray shook.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, Sir Nigel. We thought you might
have wakened, Sir Nigel. I have made
bold to bring you broth.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Broth? Yes, of course. Broth and Mary
would go together. He sat up, took it
from her hand, and supped it hungrily.</p>

<p class='c010'>She watched him, with eyes which held
a strange mingling of love, fear, and wonder.
The love, a life-long fidelity. The
fear came with the remembrance of a coffin,
beside which she had stood; of a grave in
the churchyard on the hill side. The wonder
was born of a mystery, unexplained,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_179'>179</span>unaccountable, but accepted with the simple
faith of a mind ruled by the heart.</p>

<p class='c010'>“How did I get here, Mary?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Thomas will tell you, Sir Nigel.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“You tell me. I like hearing your dear
old voice.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Thomas found you by the rocks, Sir
Nigel. He fetched the foresters, and they
brought you up on a hurdle.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“How did Thomas know I had been
swimming?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Her ladyship gave the alarm.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ah! Who put me to bed?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Thomas and the doctor.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The doctor? What doctor.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“They fetched the doctor, Sir Nigel.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I see. Thank you, Mary; the broth was
very good. Now, where are my clothes?
I want to get up.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I will send Thomas, Sir Nigel.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Left alone, he pondered. What had they
told this doctor? Would he also rise, a
familiar figure, from the well of sub-conscious
memory?</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_180'>180</span>The door opened again. The old butler
entered, closing it carefully behind him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Thomas, come here. I have been talking
to Mary.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“So I hear, Sir Nigel.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“She tells me the foresters carried me
up from the shore. Do they know me,
Thomas?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No, Sir Nigel. They are young men,
sons of Fergusson and Graem.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I see. How about this doctor?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“He has been her ladyship’s medical attendant
for a matter of twenty-five years,
Sir Nigel.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Twenty-five years? Ah! What did you
say to him? How did you explain my
presence here?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“We told him you were an old friend of
her ladyship’s whom she had met abroad.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Abroad?” He dived into the well. “Ah,
yes! That was true, wasn’t it? Where——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Italy, Sir Nigel.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes; Florence. Good Lord! What else
did you tell the doctor?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_181'>181</span>“That you dined here last evening, and
spent the night; went for an early swim
this morning, and got caught by the current.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Good. Who else—er—remembers, beside
you and Mary?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No one, Sir Nigel. We alone are left,
of the old staff.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Thomas, bring my clothes. I must get
up.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“See the doctor first, Sir Nigel.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No need. I am all right. There is
but one person I want to see. Where is
she, Thomas?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Her ladyship is in her room, Sir Nigel.”
The old man’s face worked. “The doctor
is with her ladyship.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The doctor? What’s up, Thomas? Is
anything wrong?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Wrong? Wrong, Sir Nigel! Merciful
God!” He wrung his hands helplessly. “It’s
best you should hear it from me, Sir Nigel.
Our dear lady is dying. We thought she
was gone when we found her. But the
<span class='pageno' id='Page_182'>182</span>doctor brought remedies in his bag. He revived
her. She is conscious again, and
knows us. But he says she can’t last
through the day.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He leapt from the bed.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Quick! My clothes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“For God’s sake, sir, be calm! For her
ladyship’s sake; for all our sakes. It will
seem like madness. Don’t do aught that
might disturb her peace. The country side
will ring with it. They have talked for
years. They will say she died insane.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“My clothes, Thomas.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Those you came in are soaked with sea
water, Sir Nigel. But we have plenty here.
Her ladyship had them all kept ready, and
always brushed and aired.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He went to a chest of drawers and fumbled
blindly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Your flannels, Sir Nigel? She would
like best to see you in what you wore that
day. The coat you flung to her as you ran
down the beach, she keeps in her own room.
But here are others all complete.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_183'>183</span>With trembling hands, he laid them on
a chair. “All you need is here, Sir Nigel.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Then leave me, Thomas. But come back
in five minutes.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He dressed rapidly.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Dying! My wife dying! She shall not
die. By heaven, she shall not die!”</p>

<p class='c010'>As he slipped on the coat, there came a
quick rap on the door.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes; come in! Now, Thomas——” Ah,
the doctor. With an effort he pulled himself
together. “Good morning.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“So you’re up and dressed? I thought
you would soon be all right when that
stupor of exhaustion passed into natural
sleep. You’ll do. I did what I could for
you, Mr.——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“My name is Luke Sparrow.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ah, Mr. Sparrow. But my hands were
full, from the first, with poor Lady Tintagel.
Sad business, very. And the daughter
and son-in-law went off motoring early
this morning a four days’ tour, leaving no
address. Haven’t traced them yet. Stupid
<span class='pageno' id='Page_184'>184</span>thing to do. Not that she wants them, poor
lady. And the quieter she is, the better.
But she is asking for you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The little man jerked over to the window,
and fussed with the blind cord.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Is there immediate danger?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Danger? My dear sir, she is dying,
would have been dead now, had I not had
powerful restoratives handy. She can’t
last out the day. Her heart has been dicky
for years. Any shock might have done
this. Thirty years ago her husband was
drowned before her eyes—as you may have
heard—down on this beach. A most devoted
couple, so I’m told. Wrapped up,
etc.; you know the sort of thing. The shock
nearly killed her. Look at that wonderful
white hair! It isn’t age. It was as
white as it is to-day, when they went to
her the morning after he was drowned, and
she only twenty-eight, and beautiful as a
June morning. I came to these parts a
couple of years later. Sad case! She recovered
physically, bar the heart trouble;
<span class='pageno' id='Page_185'>185</span>but her mind has been touched on one point
ever since. Always expecting him back.
Sea give up its dead, I suppose. You know
the kind of thing? I always say they
should have let her see the corpse; might
have cured her. But, after a week in the
water! Not a pretty sight, you know.
Acted for the best no doubt. Oh, she never
speaks of it to me. But people talk you
know; say she always keeps his room ready,
and so forth. Mania, of course, but harmless,
poor lady. Why do fine chaps such
as he, throw away their lives for worthless
young women; couldn’t sail a boat; better
drowned. Thousand pities. So she watches
the sea and, I suppose, saw you in difficulties.
Gave her a shock; brought back the
scene. Thomas and his wife are very close;
told me nothing. But her maid—nice girl—said
she shrieked: ‘Sir Nigel is drowning
below the cliff; a boat! a rope!’ Poor
soul! Sane enough, now; but heart done
for.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“May I see her?”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_186'>186</span>“Why not? She keeps asking for you, so
Mrs. Thomas tells me. She will be gone
at once, if she makes any effort or sits up.
But she can’t last out the day, and she may
as well have what she wants and die happy,
as die, three hours later, wanting it. I had
a patient once who was dying; apparently
nothing could save her; and she wanted to
go out into her garden, lovely garden it
was, too. Nurses and relations wouldn’t
hear of it. ‘Why, doctor, it might kill
her!’ ‘Good Lord,’ said I, ‘and if it does?
Let her die in the garden, if she wishes.
Isn’t it a sweeter place to die in than her
bed?’ So they carried her out, and blest
if she didn’t rally from that hour and get
well! Queer things, bodies! Well, I must
be off. There’s nothing further to be done
here; and I’ve a baby on hand, waiting to
enter the world, which is, after all, of more
importance than a lady waiting to make her
exit.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Can nothing be done to relieve——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“She is in no pain, and won’t be. I will
<span class='pageno' id='Page_187'>187</span>be back in three hours. You will stay on,
I suppose, and being an old friend, you can
see to things, until these motorists are
found. A shock for them, but they deserve
it; going off and leaving no address! And,
between ourselves, they’ll be pleased to
come into the property and the money.
They’ve not been much to her, nor she to
them. She was what I called ‘a <em>one man</em>
woman.’ While she had him, because he
filled her heart, it was open to all. But
when she lost him, she lost her all, and
her empty heart closed to others. That is
why I curse those French girls; throttling
that splendid fellow with their foolish fingers.
Who wanted them? And at such a
cost! Well, goodbye, for the present——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Can you not leave instructions as to
what is to be done for Lady Tintagel?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“The housekeeper has full instructions,
and I have left stimulating draughts with
her. Keep the patient quiet. Give her all
she wants. Do, without question, everything
she asks. Don’t let more than one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_188'>188</span>person be in her room at the same time,
unless help is needed. Don’t attempt to
move her. She lies where they put her at
first, on a couch near the window, looking
out over the sea. I wouldn’t let them move
her. It’s such a silly fad always to want
people to die in their beds. It rejoices
my heart when I hear of a parson dying
in the pulpit. Please God, I’ll either die in
my gig or on the links. Good morning,
Mr. Sparrow. See you later on.”</p>

<p class='c010'>Silence at last.</p>

<p class='c010'>He went over to the window, and leaned
his forehead against the glass.</p>

<p class='c010'>He must go to her now. She wanted
him, and the time was short. Thank God,
he would have her alone. Surely Divine
interposition had given them thus to each
other. He must just wait until he could be
sure that the noisy little man, who had
filled the room with babel, was clear out of
the house.</p>

<p class='c010'>Mrs. Thomas tapped and entered.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_189'>189</span>“Her ladyship asks for you, Sir Nigel.
She is alone.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Shew me her room, Mary,” he said; but,
in the same moment, turning from her,
walked across the room, drew back a curtain
and found the door of communication
behind it. He opened it. Double doors.
Yes, of course. She had liked the absolute
security of double doors to their own
room.</p>

<p class='c010'>One moment he waited, took a deep
breath, laid firm hold upon himself; then
opened the door, and passed into the quiet
room beyond.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>SCENE XIII<br /> <span class='large'>“NEVERTHELESS——”</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>She lay upon the couch, near the open
window, very white and still.</p>

<p class='c010'>She was gazing out across the sea;
but, as he closed the door, she turned her
eyes and watched him, while he walked
over to the couch; and those patient eyes
were so full of unutterable love and longing,
that his throat closed on the words
he had meant to say.</p>

<p class='c010'>He knelt down beside her, took both
her hands in his, and laid his lips upon
them.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Miriam! Miriam!”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nigel, you do remember?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, my belovèd, my wife, my own—thank
God, I do remember. And I love
you with every fibre of my being.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_194'>194</span>He knew the time was short. There
must be no delay.</p>

<p class='c010'>He drew her wedding-ring from his finger,
slipped it back to its rightful place, and
laid his lips on ring and finger together.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I love you utterly,” he said, “and I hold
you mine for ever.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nigel, my husband, this time it is I who
go, and you who remain behind. You will
be braver than I.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“My own,” he answered, “we shall be
together in the place where alone true joys
are to be found; safe within the circle of the
Will of God. Since I left you and went out
into the sunrise, I, who before was empty,
have become rich beyond all human comprehension
in the possession of three different
memories. I remember the thirty
years of this present life. I remember the
precious love which was ours in the life
before, and, remembering that, my heart
has grown so rich that I care not to remember
aught else of that life, but just the
utter sweetness of our wedded love. And,
<span class='pageno' id='Page_195'>195</span>best of all, it has been granted me to remember
something of the wonder of that
eternal Dwelling Place—that short while in
Eternity, before our great love drew me
back to Time—not in detail, but in its
larger lines of truth.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Ah, tell me that,” she whispered. “I
know the precious past. I know much of
the present. Tell me of the Eternity between.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“God’s love,” he said, “is the great Dwelling
Place; God’s Will, the very air we
breathe. The passionate desire of every
soul, freed from the earthly prison of the
flesh, is to return that love, to do that Will.
The Son of God, walking the earth as man—though
emptied, for the time being, of
His eternal memory—remembered this, and
gave His fellow men the perfect prayer:
‘Thy will be done in earth, as it is in
Heaven.’ When that prayer finds its complete
fulfilment, earth’s hard perplexities
will all be solved, earth’s tears all wiped
away. His perfect Will ensures man’s perfect
<span class='pageno' id='Page_196'>196</span>joy. The next petition in the pattern
prayer bears out this thought. ‘Give us this
day our daily bread.’ What food is to the
body, doing the Will of God is to the soul.
He Who taught us thus to pray, was the
one man who could say with absolute honesty:
‘My meat is to do the Will of Him
that sent me.’</p>

<p class='c010'>“All souls know this by instinct. The
sinner knows it in his sin, and fails to find
in sin a lasting pleasure. The agnostic
knows it in his search after something
which can meet and satisfy the craving of
his mind. The martyr knows it, and laughs
at the cruel flame. The angels know it,
and fly swiftly on strong wings. Christ
knew it, in Gethsemane, and hushed the
natural protest of his human agony, and
summed up His life’s purpose in those perfect
words: ‘Nevertheless, not my will, but
Thine be done.’ When the last rebel soul
has yielded and understood, then the great
End will come; God will be All in all.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_197'>197</span>He paused and laid his forehead upon
her folded hands.</p>

<p class='c010'>“My wife, our sacred love must stand
this test. This is the fire which burns up
all the dross, but leaves us, as eternal treasure,
the gold and precious stones.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Just now I woke, filled with the rapture
of our love, the joy, beyond all words, of
having found you. Almost at once, I heard
that I must lose you. My flesh cried out:
‘I cannot let her go!’ Then came the Angel
of His love and pity, and laid a strengthening
hand upon my soul, and said: ‘This
is God’s Will, His perfect way for her and
you.’ Belovèd, to that Will we both must
bow. Thus shall we find our purest joy, and
love which has no ending.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nigel,” she whispered, “I brought you
back empty, and I leave you desolate.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He waited till his voice was steady, then
replied:</p>

<p class='c010'>“Listen, sweet wife of mine! Our love
has brought me Home. Through you there
comes to me this chance to put myself once
<span class='pageno' id='Page_198'>198</span>more within the Will of God. Together we
accept, in faith and patience, this parting
we are called upon to face, and thus atone
for the mistaken past. Mine is the harder
part, I know; but I would have it so. I
left you to the harder part before. I shall
be lonely, but not desolate. I owe a debt to
life for thirty selfish, wasted years. If a
great chance comes, I may pay it soon.
That will be as God wills. But, be the parting
long or short, always I shall know you
watch and wait for me; and, thanks again
to you, I shall not be earth-bound; for,
where my Treasure is, there will my heart
be also.”</p>

<p class='c010'>At last he lifted his head and looked at
her.</p>

<p class='c010'>Then his courage almost broke. That
lovely face, so dear, so well-remembered.
Those lips, parting in soft surrender. The
tenderness his heart so hungered for, dwelling
upon him in those dying eyes.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, I can’t!” he said, and hid his face
against her breast. “My God, give us one
<span class='pageno' id='Page_199'>199</span>year! If it be possible, let this cup pass.”</p>

<p class='c010'>She laid her hands upon his head and
held him close.</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘Nevertheless——’” she said: “Oh,
Nigel, finish it!”</p>

<p class='c010'>And, in a voice broken by sobs, he spoke
the sacred words which make complete a
brave soul’s sacrifice.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>SCENE XIV<br /> <span class='large'>“NO SADNESS OF FAREWELL”</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>The hours which followed seemed
to him the nearest approach
to heaven a man could know
on earth.</p>

<p class='c010'>Sometimes she lay in his arms and gently
slept; then roused herself to drink what
Mary brought, and rallying a little, let her
eyes dwell on his face, as he sat beside her
in the sunshine, talking softly of many
things—the past, the future; all their love
had meant; would mean.</p>

<p class='c010'>Deep peace enveloped them. Time stood
still and waited while they drank deeply
of a fount of love, slaking the thirst of
years. Words could scarce carry the tender
emotion of all they had to say to one
another. Because of her great weakness, it
was chiefly he who spoke and she who listened.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_204'>204</span>But sometimes she rallied, and uttered
words which he knew he would carry
in his heart for ever.</p>

<p class='c010'>Twice he left her; when the doctor returned
amazed to find her still alive, and
so content; and when she sent for Thomas,
to bid the faithful old man farewell, and to
give him last instructions.</p>

<p class='c010'>This time, when Luke returned, she
beckoned to him anxiously.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nigel, all this is yours; the house, the
property; all should be yours.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He smiled. “My dearest, no! Not this
time. <em>You</em> are mine, and I want nothing
more. I arrived with a knapsack; I shall
depart with a knapsack. I am just a tramp,
you know; but a happy tramp, with a kingdom
in my heart.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Nigel—one thing—you will not refuse?
My despatch-box—full of letters—yours
and mine; and the photographs. You will
take that?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Yes, my belovèd, I gladly will.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“A few other things are in it—sacred to
<span class='pageno' id='Page_205'>205</span>us; a miniature you had done of me the
year before—you went. And lately—I have
kept—in a sealed envelope-a thousand
pounds in bank notes, in case of just such
an emergency as this. Nigel—you will?
To please me? It is all yours, really. You
might wish to go abroad—travel——”</p>

<p class='c010'>He hesitated. “Miriam, I have all I
need.” Her eyes pleaded. “All right, my
darling. The case and all that’s in it. Your
gift to me.” He bent and kissed her fluttering
fingers. “Don’t be troubled, dear
Heart. Such a perfect thought of yours.
I will do beautiful things with it; things
you would have liked to plan. They will
be my own wife’s gifts to me.”</p>

<p class='c010'>She smiled and closed her eyes, content.</p>

<p class='c010'>At sunset he knew their one day was
over.</p>

<p class='c010'>He gave her the draught the doctor had
left for a last emergency, and momentarily
she revived.</p>

<p class='c010'>Her eyes left his face, to gaze across the
sea.</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_206'>206</span>“‘Sunset and evening star,’” she whispered,
“‘And one clear call for me.’ Say
it, Nigel.”</p>

<p class='c010'>His great love made him brave.</p>

<p class='c010'>He repeated the lines, and the deep, sweet
music of his voice, as it reached her, held
no tremor. Only, he looked away across
the sea; not at the dying face.</p>

<p class='c010'>“‘No sadness of farewell’,” she said.
“Nigel, is that possible?”</p>

<p class='c010'>Then he turned, smiling bravely.</p>

<p class='c010'>“All is possible, my dearest, to a perfect
love.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, raise me,” she whispered, “and take
me in your arms.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He held her close.</p>

<p class='c010'>She lifted her face to his.</p>

<p class='c010'>That look of love unspeakable, broke his
iron self-control.</p>

<p class='c010'>His tears fell on her face.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I know!” she said, and suddenly her
voice was strong and full. “My lover and
my husband! But it is all joy—no sadness,
really. And such a little while——”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_207'>207</span>“All joy, my wife,” he answered; then,
bending, laid his lips on hers.</p>

<p class='c010'>And in that perfect kiss, her spirit
passed.</p>

  <h2 class='c005'>SCENE XV<br /> <span class='large'>“THE SECRETS OF OUR HEARTS”</span></h2>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>The stranger from the inn stood
with the mourners at the open
grave, in the churchyard on the
hillside.</p>

<p class='c010'>The son and daughter glanced across,
and wondered vaguely who he was, and
why he stood so near.</p>

<p class='c010'>Another coffin, hidden during thirty
years, had seen the light that day; for the
bricked grave had been so planned that
two might lie within it, side by side.</p>

<p class='c010'>Into the empty space they lowered the
new coffin, with its bright silver fittings
and polished wood, slipping it carefully into
place beside the one which had rested there
so long.</p>

<p class='c010'>The mourners bent and looked into the
grave, while the new coffin slowly passed
<span class='pageno' id='Page_212'>212</span>from view; but the stranger kept his eyes
lifted to the tree tops. His quiet face, so
striking in its dark beauty, shewed no signs
of deep emotion; yet, to many there, he
seemed to be chief mourner.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='fixed'>Man that is born of a woman hath but a short
time to live, and is full of misery. He cometh
up, and is cut down, like a flower; he fleeth as it
were a shadow, and never continueth in one stay.</span></p>

<p class='c010'><span class='fixed'>In the midst of life we are in death: of whom
may we seek for succour, but of Thee, O Lord,
Who for our sins art justly displeased?</span></p>

<p class='c010'><span class='fixed'>Yet, O Lord God most holy, O Lord most
mighty, O holy and most merciful Saviour, deliver
us not into the bitter pains of eternal death.</span></p>

<p class='c010'><span class='fixed'>Thou knowest, Lord, the secrets of our
hearts; shut not Thy merciful ears to our
prayer; but spare us, Lord most holy, O God
most mighty, O holy and merciful Saviour,
Thou most worthy Judge eternal, suffer us not,
at our last hour, for any pains of death, to fall
from Thee.</span></p>

<p class='c011'>As the handful of earth fell with a sudden
thud upon the coffin, the stranger
started, seemed to awake to the actualities
<span class='pageno' id='Page_213'>213</span>around him, took a step forward, and
looked down into the grave.</p>

<p class='c010'>Yes; side by side they lay—the two. One
looked very grand and new beside the other,
though careful hands had polished that and
made it passable, to face the light of day.</p>

<p class='c010'>The inscription on the large brass plate
was clearly legible, and left no doubt as to
what lay beneath the lid.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>While he pondered these words, in solemn
awe and silence, there fell upon his ears the
Church’s triumphant promise of Life, which
overcomes the grave; of faith, which changes
death to life eternal.</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='fixed'>O merciful God, the Father of our Lord

meekly beseech Thee, O Father, to raise us from

that, when we shall depart this life, we may rest
in Him, as our hope is this our sister doth——</span></p>

<p class='c011'>“This our sister?” The shadow of a
smile passed across the dark face, gazing so
intently at the two coffins. How well he
knew that the one, whatever its brass plate
might say, held only a suit of clothes, spoilt
by sea water, empty and done with. How
easy it made it for him to realise that this
new coffin, inscribed</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
  <div class='nf-center'>
    <div>MIRIAM TINTAGEL</div>

</div>

<p class='c015'>also held naught save an empty gown—a
very lovely robe, sacred and precious, because
worn by her, but nothing more.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Miriam, belovèd! Do you smile to see
us standing here in our trappings of woe?
Can you look back through that open door
by which you passed into the radiance of
<span class='pageno' id='Page_215'>215</span>Eternity, and see this little patch of Time,
and mark the pomp and ceremony with
which your worn-out garment is laid to rest
beside mine? Do you see your husband,
as he stands looking down upon his own
coffin? And do you understand how strange
is the experience, one through which probably
no other man has ever passed?”</p>

<p class='c011'><span class='fixed'>The grace of our Lord Jesus Christ, and
the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy
Ghost, be with us all evermore.</span> <em>Amen.</em></p>

<p class='c011'>It was over at last, that tenderest of all
the sacred services in the great Church’s
Liturgy. Living and Dead were alike dismissed
with those comprehensive words of
grace, love, and fellowship; the threefold
blessing of the Triune God.</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>Colin and Eva walked down the hill
together, sympathetic friends and
humble dependents standing aside
to let them pass.</p>

<p class='c010'>They talked in low voices, decorously;
but the sense of relief from tension which
follows on a funeral, shewed in their
brightening faces, as they turned with undisguised
pleasure toward the beautiful
house which was now their own possession.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Colin, I know why that man’s face
seemed familiar to me. You remember I
whispered to you when we noticed him in
the church, that I was certain I had seen
him before?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well? Had you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“No. But—it’s very curious. Just as
we turned from the grave—you saw how he
<span class='pageno' id='Page_220'>220</span>stood gazing down at the coffins?—he
looked up, and his eyes met mine. Then I
remembered. He is extraordinarily like the
photographs of my father.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Could he be a relation?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Not that I know of. My father was an
only child, and I never heard of cousins.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Well, we can tell Thomas to find out

</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>Luke Sparrow strode through
the pine woods, taking a short
cut from the churchyard back to
the inn.</p>

<p class='c010'>His train for the south, left in an hour.</p>

<p class='c010'>Hurrying footsteps came behind him. At
first he took them for an echo of his own;
then realised that he was being followed,
and walked the faster. He had no wish
to be accosted.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sir Nigel! Sir Nigel!”</p>

<p class='c010'>He stopped and turned sharply.</p>

<p class='c010'>Old Thomas, breathless, in deepest black,
was hastening down the stony path.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Your pardon, Sir Nigel. May I speak
with you?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“What is it, old friend?”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Sir Nigel, you are going? Don’t leave
<span class='pageno' id='Page_224'>224</span>us behind, Mary and me. Now we have
lost our dear lady, we cannot stay here. Already
there are changes. We shall not be
wanted. We know too much about our
lady’s ways and wishes. Pipes in the Oak
Room she never did allow, nor whisky and
soda in the morning. Her ladyship’s last
word to me was: ‘If possible, go with Sir
Nigel, Thomas, you and Mary. You know
his ways, and I would like to feel Mary
was there to do his mending and airing,
and see that he has properly cooked meals.’
Our dear lady has left an annuity of two
hundred a year between us, and we have
our savings, and no encumbrances, thank
God. It isn’t a question of wages; it’s a
question of home, and the Fam’ly—boy and
man, Sir Nigel, for over fifty years.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He paused for breath and a pocket-handkerchief.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Your pardon, Sir Nigel.” He wiped the
tears from his furrowed cheeks. “Boy and
man, Sir Nigel, for half a century. I ran
<span class='pageno' id='Page_225'>225</span>beside your pony, sir, as you may remember.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“I don’t remember, Thomas; but <em>She</em> did;
and I have no doubt you do.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He considered.</p>

<p class='c010'>Was it really Her wish?</p>

<p class='c010'>He thought of the thousand pounds in
bank notes in the despatch-box at the inn.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Of course you shall come, old friend;
and Mary with you. But I have no home,
as yet. We must make one together. I am
going south by the express. Could you be
happy in London? I will find a cosy flat.
As soon as I have found it, I will send for
you and Mary.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The old man blew his nose.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Beg pardon, Sir Nigel.” His relief was
pathetic. “We felt if we lost you again,
we lost all. It isn’t a matter of money.
It’s service, and our lady’s wishes, and love
of you, Sir Nigel. Boy and man——”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Right. Tell Mary the thing’s settled.
I’m off in an hour, Thomas. I don’t want
any awkward questions.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_226'>226</span>“True, Sir Nigel. The doctor wanted to
know why you had left the house before the
new master and mistress arrived. He had
counted on you to give them full particulars
of our lady’s last hours. He has been hindered
from coming over until to-day, by a
very serious case. As I say to Mary, there
are always dispensations! But he has gone
down to the house now. And you were
noticed at the grave. There will be talk
in every home by nightfall. Douglas saw
you, and Fergusson and old Nannie Steer.
You remember them, Sir Nigel?”</p>

<p class='c010'>No. The sub-conscious well was rapidly
growing deeper, its memories more elusive.
Douglas, Fergusson, old Nannie Steer, conveyed
nothing to him. Only his Treasure
in the heavens was inalienably his own.
But he began to realise how largely his sub-consciousness
had drawn from hers. With
her departure from this earthly setting, all
its memories were fading into dream-like
vagueness.</p>

<p class='c010'>“To see you standing at the grave, Sir
<span class='pageno' id='Page_227'>227</span>Nigel, looking down at <em>that</em> coffin! It was
like the Judgment Day. It made my blood
run cold; and Mary well-nigh swooned.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“It need not have, Thomas; any more
than when I stood looking down into that
drawer when you shewed me my old suits,
folded and laid away by careful hands.”</p>

<p class='c010'>He stood, looking upwards. A shaft of
sunlight, piercing through the pines, fell
on his face.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Neither my wife nor I are in that grave.
There is no death, old friend. That which
we call death is fuller life—life more
abundant.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Speaking of clothes, Sir Nigel, and such
like, her ladyship gave me orders to pack
everything in the dressing-room in two
trunks and keep them in our quarters until
I knew where to send them. Her ladyship
wished you to have the things she had so
treasured. None ever went into that room,
save her ladyship and myself; or Mary, if
our lady was away. So no questions will be
asked when they find it bare. Her ladyship
<span class='pageno' id='Page_228'>228</span>also gave me a list of furniture she has left
to me and Mary, meaning it for you; her
couch in the Oak Room, your pipe-rack, her
writing-table, her easy chair, and a few
other things. She dictated the paper and
signed it that morning while the doctor was
with her; but she told me, by word of
mouth, they were left to us, for you.”</p>

<p class='c010'>So this was her way of making sure that
he should have a home, filled with sweet
memories of her. Oh, Miriam, belovèd!
Now it was for him to find that home, for
himself and these two faithful souls.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Very well, Thomas. They can come
with you and Mary when the home is ready.
I will try for a jolly little house, not a flat.
It will be more home-like. Whatever she
wished, or said, or did, is right. Only be
careful no questions are asked. You know
what people would say if they knew of the
happenings of this past week? They would
say that she, and you, and I, were mad.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The old man smiled. “It don’t matter
what folk say, Sir Nigel. All that really
<span class='pageno' id='Page_229'>229</span>matters, is what our own hearts know;
and that her ladyship died happy.”</p>

<p class='c011'>As Luke Sparrow walked on alone, at a
rapid pace, through the pine woods, he repeated
those words to himself. “All that
really matters is what our own hearts
know.” Aye, how true! That, and one
thing more. “Thou knowest, Lord, the secrets
of our hearts.”</p>

<div class='nf-center-c0'>
<div class='nf-center c002'>
    <div><em>Three months later</em></div>
  </div>
</div>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>Luke Sparrow sat at his writing-table
reading “proof.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The cosy study was filled with
books and littered with the work he loved.</p>

<p class='c010'>Presently, with noiseless step, entered
old Thomas; turned on the lights, made
the fire blaze, stealthily tidied the room,
moved a small table to the couch, and
brought in the tea.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Take it while it’s hot, Sir Nigel.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“All right, Thomas.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mary has made a dish of those bannocks,
Sir Nigel, of which you and her
ladyship used to be so fond.”</p>

<p class='c010'>“Mary is a wonder, Thomas. Her memory
is as excellent as her cooking. All
right; I’ll take half an hour off. I’ve done
<span class='pageno' id='Page_234'>234</span>a good day’s work already.... No; don’t
draw the curtains yet awhile. There may
be some lonely soul passing by, in the cold
and dark out there, who will enjoy the sight
of this cosy warmth and brightness. I will
draw them, when I get back to work.”</p>

<p class='c010'>As the old man left the room, closing
the door behind him, Luke Sparrow pushed
aside his mass of papers, rose, flung himself
upon the couch, stretched his limbs,
and shook off the strain of long hours of
concentration.</p>

<p class='c010'>A tempting tea tray, arranged with much
care and thought, was at his elbow.
Mary’s golden bannocks stood for memories—memories
not his own; but he took
them, on trust, from Mary.</p>

<p class='c010'>The room was a perfect combination of
work and comfort; outside interests and
home.</p>

<p class='c010'>He took a miniature-case from his pocket
and opened it. Exquisitely painted on
ivory, the lovely face looked out at him; the
lips smiled their message of abiding tenderness.
<span class='pageno' id='Page_235'>235</span>It had been painted before the night
which turned that bright hair white. Of
all the treasures he had found in the despatch-box,
this meant the most to him.</p>

<p class='c010'>He looked long at it now, as he sat alone
upon that couch on which he had once lain
with her arms wrapped around him.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Miriam, belovèd,” he said, “I think you
would like this home of ours. And I believe
you would like my book. And I am
sure you would be amused to know that
Mary drags old Thomas out ‘of an evening’
to see ‘the pictures.’ Mary is having the
time of her life, and Thomas thinks it is
bad for Mary’s soul. But you and I would
agree that Mary’s soul can stand a little
more gaiety than her life with Thomas has
hitherto provided.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Now I must pour out my own tea from
your beautiful William the Fourth silver
teapot, so solid and embossed, and sturdy
on its little feet, with a pair of acorns on
the lid.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Miriam, do you know how lonely it is
<span class='pageno' id='Page_236'>236</span>to have all this, yet not to have you? And
so slowly the months pass; and so many
years are yet to come.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Oh, my belovèd! Send me thoughts of
hope and patience, and strength to play the
man.”</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>Luke Sparrow, erect and vigorous,
in the khaki uniform which
had begun to mean so much to England,
stood on his study hearth-rug, giving
final instructions to his old servant.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I’m in luck, Thomas. So early in the
day; but I lost no time, and it’s France for
me to-morrow; and, please God, that means
Belgium, and in the thick of it. You will
look after things, till I get back. Don’t let
Mary fret. Give her a cheerful time.</p>

<p class='c010'>“If I don’t return, my things will come
back to you. My will is in that drawer.
Everything will belong to you two faithful
souls. That is what her ladyship would
wish.... That’s all right, Thomas. Yes, I
<span class='pageno' id='Page_240'>240</span>know all about it. Goodbye, old friend....</p>

<p class='drop-capa0_0_6 c009'>A forest of white crosses on the

<p class='c010'>Two British soldiers moved
among them, seeking a special name.</p>

<p class='c010'>At length they found it.</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>“Ah, here it is! Here he lies. Well,
there are many above ground, hale and
hearty, who but for him would be lying as
he lies to-day; and I’m one of them.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Brave? Good Lord, he didn’t know
what fear meant! Each time he went over
the top you might have thought he was
going to his bridal. He used to call this
bloody war the Great Chance. And such
<span class='pageno' id='Page_244'>244</span>a pal! Do you mind how it kept our spirits
up only to look at him, let alone his hand
on your shoulder or his voice in your ear?</p>

<p class='c010'>“But life-saving was his passion. No
place was too hot for him, if a helpless man
lay there to be brought in. V.C.? He
earned it thirty times over! And always
came through all right.</p>

<p class='c010'>“But at last they got him, and no mistake
about it. Both legs, and through the chest;
past operating.</p>

<p class='c010'>“I was with him at the end. He’d been
lying very still, just groaning a bit on the
quiet; when suddenly he rises up on his
elbow and shouts, ‘Coming!’ clear as a
bugle call. ‘Coming!’ he says, and falls
back dead.”</p>

<p class='c010'>The two stood looking at the simple
white cross and the grave it marked; then
turned to watch an old man, in sombre
clothing, who moved among the graves,
anxiously seeking. He carried in his hand
a wreath of immortelles.</p>

<p class='c010'>At last he drew near, read Luke Sparrow’s
<span class='pageno' id='Page_245'>245</span>name, and, baring his head, fell upon
his knees beside the cross, and sobbed.</p>

<p class='c010'>The soldiers turned away, respecting the
old man’s grief.</p>

<p class='c010'>After a while he rose, laid the wreath at
the foot of the cross, and went his way.</p>

<p class='c010'>Luke Sparrow’s comrades came back and
stooped to read what was written on a card
attached to the wreath.</p>

<p class='c010'>“Hullo!” said one, “The old chap has
made a mistake. See here!”</p>

  </div>
</div>

<p class='c010'>“Leave it alone,” said the other soldier.
“He was worth a score of barts! Let him
keep the wreath.”</p>

<p class='c010'><span class='pageno' id='Page_246'>246</span>Then they also went their way.</p>

<p class='c011'>And the winds of God blew gently over
that forest of plain crosses, bearing the
vast army of heroic names, which are not
forgotten before God, but inscribed for
ever in the Book of Life.</p>

humor with a lovable small heroine who has “a
warm heart and a largish size in shoes”—a tale
of utmost charm and much of the lore of the
East and West that has filled the story-books

young and old alike. You will love Fiona and
her father the Student and undoubtedly you
will be well disposed toward the Urchin—but
whether you will care for Jeconiah—well you
must decide that for yourself.</p>

thrown half dead on scorching African sands.</p>

<p class='c010'>Six days later a ship’s boat plunges through
the breakers containing six bodies, apparently
dead from hunger and thirst—but one
breathes, a woman. Face to face with the
eternal impulses of life, these three souls,
completely isolated from the civilized world,
work out their destiny through the instincts
and impulses of primitive man. A fantastic
tale, yet real and plausible, thrilling in
parts, and as whimsical as <cite>The City of Beautiful
Nonsense</cite>.</p>
